5,"Update 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10 with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.

5,"This is my review after 2 days :Screen: Coming from a screen with a higher resolution than the 7T, I was weary about the screen. However the AMOLED screen on this phone blew me away with it's contrast and brightness. The 90Hz screen is another killer feature. A lot of people still seem to wonder if it makes a difference, I think it does. A friend of mine who hadn't heard of this phone before tried it and was immediately impressed by the smooth scrolling and animations.This is most definitely the best aspect of this phone.Performance: This is phone is rapid! I haven't encountered a hiccup yet. I do not game and hence cannot comment on the gaming performance. However I am a heavy user and didn't find anything that slowed down this phone. I'm also very pleased with the clean Android experience with Oxygen OS's useful features. Both face recognition and the finger print scanner are fastBattery: This is where I was seriously doubting the capabilities of this phone. However I'm pleased to report that I've had more than 6.5 hours of screen on time on both days. This included a lot of YouTube and Netflix using the phones speakers. This phone should easily get you through a day of use. I had also kept WiFi, Mobile Data (4G) and Location on at all times. Unless you are expecting something that lasts for 2 days , this phone won't disappoint. The new Warp charge 30T is amazing as well.Speakers: The speakers are something I did not consider much about while purchasing this device. But they've impressed me immensely. Dialogue is crisp and it gets plenty loud. I did try using my wired earphones with a OnePlus USB-C to 3.5mm adaptor and I didn't have any issues with the sound.Cameras: I have not tested the camera enough to post a review about them, nor am I a photographer. I will update this review when I do take more picturesHand feel: The phone feels solidly built. I did expect it to be heavier. It doesn't feel heavy at all and the weight is distributed very well, making it very easy to hold. Make no mistake, it is a large phone. However I found it much easier to handle than the 7 Pro which I was considering thanks to the flat screen, slightly narrower width and the evenly distributed weight.I do wish they did provide a USB-C to 3.5mm adaptor in the box. (3.5mm jack would be ideal. But that ship has sailed). Apart from this minor gripe, I'm very happy with this purchase.(For context, I have used a Samsung S5, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7 Plus and Nokia 8 as my daily drivers before this)

5,"Changed from a Pixel XL (1st gen first-adopter) to this phone and I must say, I do not regret it at all! This is a review after having used the phone for about 3 days.Let me start with listing out the pros and cons.Pros:# Beautiful display with accurate colour reproduction# Pretty loud surround speakers! The earpiece doubles as a speaker and is neatly placed at the top edge of the phone. (I would use about 80% volume on the Pixel, one the 7T I find 30% to be loud enough!)# Camera images are pretty good! I still find the Pixel to be a better shooter, but the 7T is not far behind. Just requires you to have a more steadier hand when clicking.# 128gb of space with 100+ usable memory and UFS 3.0!# 8gb RAM which is plenty sufficient for everyday usage.# Oxygen OS which will help you tweak all the above to suit your specific requirements.# Super tiny notch which seamlessly merges with the icons at the top.# Sturdy transparent case and screen protector applied straight off the box.# Charging speed is truly amazing! I got about 85% in 30min!# Gesture control is smooth and dark mode is quite neat.# Fingerprint reader is really quick which is a happy surprise coming from my experience with the OP7 which was sluggish.Cons:# No headphone jack dongle!# Battery backup is not great, but it can last you a day max with average usage.# No control on notch display for those looking for it.# Found the auto-brightness to be very effective under direct light but it gets too dark when the phone is angled away from light. This could probably improve with usage.I would definitely recommend this phone for anyone looking for the latest SoC and tech hardware at a reasonable price. I was able to exchange and pick this up at ~10k lesser than the MRP.The Pixel had set me back by 76k and from a value-for-money perspective, the 7T checks all the boxes!"
5,"**Will upload photos soon**Ordered this on 28th September and had it delivered a day ahead today. I'm simply mesmerized to be honest with device's overall performance. Please don't go by the YouTube review about the box and its contents cause on reality, you get just the phone packed in its box. No earphones are included in the purchase although it was mentioned in the description while buying it.Pros:1) Stunning camera and it does delivers awesome quality. I'll upload some shots soon. The slow vid and 4k 60fps are two major plus signs. The wide and the ultrawide shots are amazing along with the macro which I'm yet to explore more.2) The screen!! It's super smooth and navigation is simply effortless. The typing response is best I've ever experienced and so is the color balance that you can set as per your preference.3) The weight and build quality is premium and defines the phone as a flagship buster. I ordered the blue one and it's quite an effect on itself.4) Silicone case is included and a thin screen protector film is already applied. The case is not a usual cheap stuff but good one.5) Dolby Atmos. Now, I've been using Dolby Atmos for more than 3 years and can tell you that it's a must for people deeply rooted into music.Cons: Device has no cons in terms of looks, performance or build quality however, I expected a bit louder speaker output. The phone without the cover is quite slippery and can easily fall off so I'm being extra careful with my new baby.Overall, this did satisfy my expectations to a great limits considering the fact that I was never an OnePlus guys. This is my first."

5,"Inside the box:-You only get the handset and the charger and a transparent case, you won't don't get any headphones.Pros:-1) The one thing that attracted me to buy this phone is its Screen. Believe me it's the best part of this phone. You can clearly feel the difference between a 60hz display and a 90hz display. The amoled panel reproduces amazing colors and it also gets decently bright.2) Duel Speakers, this has 2 speakers. One in the bottom of the phone and one in the earpeice. I think this has Dolby Atoms as well. You ll have a really good experience when it comes to audio.3) The phone is really smooth and works like butter thanks to its 90hz Screen and top end specs, switching between the apps, scrolling feels really fast.4) Cameras - the cameras on this are pretty decent and the front facing camera is not a pop up one so no moving parts. The notch is small.5) Super fast charging - phone comes with the fast charger inside the box and it's crazy fast to charge the phone. It's faster than OnePlus 5.6) The Screen - ohhh the screen.. viewing content on this screen is mind blowing.. its the best part of this phone.Cons:-1) Size of the phone, when it comes to the dimensions of the phone I think it gets really tricky to handle this phone while typing or vertical use. Its a bit heavy as well. The phone is a bit thick as well as compared to Oneplus 5 my privious phone which was the perfect size and weight.2) I think the battery backup could have been better. The screen eats up the battery. I was not using my phone that intensively and still the battery drained faster as compared to my previous phone. (Fast charging helps though)3) No headphone jack - well this was going to be the deal breaker for me in buying this phone but I went for it. This phone doesn't have a headphone jack and also OnePlus doesn't even provide the type C to 3.5mm adapter out of the box.. will have to buy it separately or use bluetooth headphones which will again have a toll on the battery life.4) The big camera bump on the back. Yes it's too big and if you don't use a backcover you phone will always be uneven on the surface. It looks not that great too.5) And one thing that I noticed is that this phone comes with a pre applied screen guard, but the plastic doesn't cover the whole screen area, so when I had the back gestures enabled from the right bottom corner my finger used to scrach on that screen guard which was very unpleasant and I was worried that constant scratching might loosen the screen guard and it would peel off or something, so I had to disable those gestures and use the on Screen buttons to navigate.6) I dont know if its the software issue or the camera itself but the picture quality of the cameras is not that great or what I was hoping for.All in all. This is a good phone for the price that it comes."
5,"The brand has delivered once again. I have been using the OnePlus 7 before this. But the 7T is not just an incremental upgrade. It has much more to it. Let's start with a few key differences between the OnePlus 7 and 7T1) The vibration motor has now haptic feedback. Much better than linear motor on op 7 and almost similar to OP7 Pro. I love it.2) The phone is slimmer and has a better feel in hand though bigger but has a more sharp corners which adds decency in contrast to rounded corners on OP7. Also notch size is reduced.3) the cameras. Well everyone knows about the cameras. I would like to say that the macro lens that uses the ultrawide lens, is not just a gimmick. It can take photos of fabrics that even the eyes cannot see.4) the smoothness of 90hz screen is just really good to experience.5) The antutu benchmark score. 400000 in comparison to 370000 of oneplus.6) the dual speakers. The ear piece speaker has now higher volume than bottom speaker. On the 7 it was opposite. Also 7t's sound is slightly richer than 7.7) Well the warp charge 30T really adds up. It charges the phone from 0 to 67 in 30 mins. And 0 to 100 in 61 mins. Saves a lot of time. Whereas the 7 takes 86 mins.8) it comes pre installed with Android 10. So 2 Android updates are guaranteed. Whereas 7 came with Pie. Most likely to get an update less.Well now the cons:1)I got a little defective piece. The screen adhesive was slightly visible on left hand side. So opted for a replacement.2) The wifi sometimes disconnects and thrn reconnects on its own. Maybe a software issue. OnePlus might fix it soon.Well got it for 36k from Amazon. A must buy phone. Cannot keep myself from recommending. Kudos to OnePlus."
5,"OnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.

5,"The OnePlus 7T packs the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+. Processing power has never been an issue with any OnePlus phone. It not an issue with the OnePlus 7T either. The phone is fast, responsive and can easily handle all multitasking, high-end videography and multi-tab browsing. The phone can manage all tasks quite well. In the few couple of days I used the phone, I never felt it was slowing down or heating up. The best aspect of OnePlus 7T camera for me is its super macro mode, which lets you get really close to a subject and click some very impressive photos with the kind of detail I have rarely seen in a smartphone camera.The Oxygen OS on the phone is based on the latest Android 10 version and this is a big plus for anyone opting for the OnePlus 7T. The OnePlus 7T has a 3800 mAh battery that can easily last a day of usage. But the new fast charge is faster than before and can bring it back up to full juice in about 45-50 minutes.Overall, performance is top notch be it switching between apps, typing a Google document, editing a photo or playing Asphalt 9 at best graphics settings.This time it is not just the under the hood upgrades that make the OnePlus 7T a catch. The bigger screen, refreshing new design, and the triple cameras are some of the other features that make it stand out in the price segment even at a slightly elevated price."
5,"I had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T, I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn't slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I've never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That's what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I'm not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won't be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half's backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it's an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half's usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It's an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn't face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn't encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail the ""Free 1-Year Extended Warranty"" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it's a True Flagship device in the 30's price bracket.I just don't know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren't a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can't use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don't find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it's ""Unofficially"" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don't try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won't regret buying it.

5,"It is the best phone till date. It is so smooth in every tasks.PROS:1) Display: Display is buttery smooth. 90Hz display gives you a smooth performance.2) Battery: Battery is not so bad as it is being said by reviewers as it is giving me around 1 and half day of battery life in aggressive usage. I play heavy games a lot like pubg and Call of duty. And still the performance is nice.3) Camera: Believe me the pictures coming out from this phone are perfect. I am a professional photographer and i am pretty impressed by the performance of the camera.And the videos are also good and so are slomos.4) Sound: Stereo speakers of this phone are insane. I have used many stereo speaker smartphones and i am telling you the speakers from this device gives better sound.5) Charging: The phone charges from 0-100% in 60-70 mins. What else you want now?CONS:1) No 3.5mm jack as you all know. And the company is not providing any 3.5mm to type-c connector.2) No IP Rating. However, the company said that the phone can bear water splashes but the certification is what makes us comfortable.3) No wireless Charging. The device has a glass back but then too there is no wireless charging.But these cons are not a deal breaker.Note: At this price range OnePlus 7T is a great deal. Go for it blindly.

5,"Firstly, I didn't receive my headset. It's mentioned on Amazon website that the customers will get a free headset in the box.This is like misleading the customers by giving false information.Secondly, I want to say. I like everything about this phone. This is my first Oneplus phone and I love Oxygen OS.Having said that, I'm facing some minor heating issues with my phone. It's on and off but it still bothers me. Didn't expect it would happen with Oneplus. Hope this can be fixed. Had heard a lot about OnePlus so, when I decided to purchase a new phone I picked OnePlus 7T over ROG 2.Battery is decent. Does not drain out quickly. Using dark mode helps a lot in saving battery even after heavy usage.I don't like the camera of this phone. When you use beauty mode it entirely changes your face and you look really weird. Samsung, Oppo, Vivo are far better when it comes to camera. Wide angle photos also come out odd. When you click objects using wide angle they come out well. But, when you click photos of people the person in the front comes out really bad. Especially with the selfie camera. This phone has the worse selfie camera.I was earlier using Samsung S7 Edge which was much smaller compared to OnePlus 7T. This phone is big. So, it will take some time for me to get adjusted to this phone."
5,"I read a lot review about this phone, and decided to buy this and bought it within10 minutes post launch. And my expectations were so high and it's been a week since got the phone, did this phone fulfill all my expectations? Let's discuss it in the pros and cons section.Pros:1. Oxygen OS - fluidic UI experience, the widgets are really precise and upto the point.2. Camera - super macro is not just a specification on paper it really makes wonder. Primary camera and front camera are both best in class.3. Snapdragon 855+ - Multitasking don't worry, gaming don't worry, WebEx meetings don't worry this guy can handle everything. Lightening fast processor.4. 90hz refresh rate - the fluidic display is another feature that's not merely on paper. Can feel the smoothness in the display. And hdr videos are a bliss to watch in 90hz5. Design - the design of the phone is premium I personally liked the circular camera socket. It makes the phone look like a beast.6. Complementary pouch: the silicon pouch provided with the phone is best in quality and it enhances the look of the phone, friosted silver looks well on the transparent cover.Cons:Battery: it comes with 3800 mAh on regular usuage the battery last only a day and 5-9 hours, can't one plus come with 5000 mAh battery?Fingerprint scanner: I feel the finger print scanner is not the fastest. However the face unlock is lightening fast almost no delay.Overall: OnePlus is known for providing best user experience and it has taken miles ahead with the launch of OnePlus 7T. Despite the fact that OnePlus 7 is not real value for money, it compensated the users expectations with 7T. 7T I would say best flagship phone with 855+ processor.Go for it guys."
5,The phone is an absolute pleasure in your hands. The look is splendid. Silver Matt back finish with mirror finish on the curves gives the classy looks it deserves. Have been using it since the last 4 days and here is a quick analysis:1. Processor is really fast. You can easily notice it as you flip between the apps2. Face recognition is super quick. At times before u even manage to put ya thumb for finger scanning the phone gets unlocked. Face recognition even in low lights is pretty impressive.3. The camera precision is brilliant. One can take stunning pics and with portrait mode on the selfie too makes it even better. Have not tested long distance and night pics so cannot comment on that as of now.4. Game mode is really cool if you are a gaming person which I am.5. The display is really bright and vibrant. You can easily feel the difference from the earlier phone that you were using6. Battery life is really excellent. I spend a lot of time on calls during office hrs and game while free time. But the battery really fights out time easily. Also the quick charge is super awesome. It barely takes like an hour for 100% battery. Just plug in for 15 mins and you can easily charge the battery good 40%.7. The phone comes with a soft transparent case so you need not bother with the drops.8. Loads of inbuilt features that will only add to the delight once you start exploring them.Bad pointJust that the charging cable is round instead of the flat cable which is not that simple to twirl and lock. Flat cable was a lot simpler. Also the cable length is standard1 mtr. I would have preferred if they gave 3 mts.
5,"It's been less than a week that I am using this phone and I think I made the best decision to pay a little extra and go for OnePlus 7t instead of OnePlus 7. I had also considered going for Samsung S10e but OnePlus took my heart with its feature richness as explained below out of which half of the features are missing in Samsung S10E.I think the display of OnePlus is far far better than the display of Samsung Phones which I considered to be the best so far.The specs provided are too good for the price. The specific specs that I loved are -1. Fluid Amoled Display2. SPEEEDDD (the 7th generation of OnePlus phones is known for its speed and it holds to that promise very well). Samsung stutters after a while with speed.3. Dolby speakers (you really don't need Bluetooth Speakers anymore)4. How can I forget Oxygen OS! If you're into hassle free yet minimum customisable OS then this one's for you.5. Camera is great too. Look in the attached samples for clarity in outdoor lighting conditions. Also a wide angle shot which does a great job with the field area covered.6. Playing PubG in gaming mode at top-end levels is super smooth and flawless.7. Fingerprint Sensor is pretty fast. Didn't experience even a single moment of complaining about indisplay sensor.8. Battery life decent enough for 9-10 hours on moderate usage but the Warp Charger makes up for all the lacking points here. Thats too quick.9. Super Macro is amazing. I loved to play around with it. Please have a look at samples which were taken keeping the camera too close to the subject and the details captured were awesome.The only con that I particularly didn't like was a - No headphone jack but when you see the overall Package. It really don't matter to me much.It looks premium and IT IS A PREMIUM ANDROID EXPERIENCE. Myself being an FANdroid lover, this is the best Android I have ever used.*Reasons to buy or not to buy -If you love Android and don't want to spend more than 40K, than go for it without thinking twice !!!Unless and until you're an Apple fan and really want to go for iPhone 11 which is nearby the price range of this, than this is the best option in this price segment.

5,"I am using oneplus products since the launch of oneplus one and till now used 5 oneplus models. Never faced any issue with any phone even after 5 years my oneplus one is still working.Now come to the 7T, I am using this phone for the last 4 days and really happy with the performance, oneplus always used a top-notch processor with 8Gb Ram and Oxygen OS just make everything flawless. This 90MHz screen on oneplus is the reason to opt for this device you can clearly see the difference in your device screen and oneplus 7T screen every single Fram is fast and smooth on this screen. Now they also improved sound quality with Dolby sound, I was using 6T and it is a very huge improvement in sound quality. Now come to the camera yes camera is very good at 7T but do not expect quality like iPhone and pixel, 7T camera can take very good shot and the way they give us the freedom to use the combination of three lenses is very useful I love this quick toggle between lense. The battery is decent for me, I am a heavy use with all the time internet on easily getting 1 and half day battery and wrap charger is cherry on top this is the fastest oneplus charger only tool 45 minutes to charge phone from 20 to 100. If you really want a practical phone with the fastest Hardware and software just go for it, no need to think twice.PS: I haven't checked gaming performance but I know this phone has the power to handle any kind of game.

5,"Editing after 3 weeks of usage of the replacement. Apart from the camera design, the phone proves to be a wonderful package. Asusual a 5 star performer from Oneplus.Delivery took a week's time. After the long wait was eager to check the triple camera setup. When i took pics in wide the too right quarter of the image was too much hazy. First i thought it was some dust in front of the cam. After a close examination could find a dent or scratch over the wide angle lens. This was causing a hazy picture. When i tried to replace the phone with amazon, they are not right away doing it and said there will be a technician at my door step in 3 days time to check on the issue. Based on his report the phone may be replaced. This is not fair, already i waited a week to get the phone and again i won't be able to use it for another week ??.I have been an oneplus admirer right from oneplus one and this have never happened with oneplus. My request to oneplus to tighten up the quality check before packing the priduct.A minute dent is making me wait almost 20 days to use your oneplus7t.Rest of the 2 cameras are super good. Macro is extraordinary and night scape has improved a lot.And focusing on my issue im uploading few pics. Check the top right corner for the haziness.Amazon please arrange the replacement as soon as possible. I may change my rating to 5 star once i get the good replacement.

5,"A true upgrade from Oneplus 7. Have been using it for 5 days and here are the pros and cons-Pros-+ 90 Hz display+ really fast charging in 30 mins it hits 70 %+ Oxygen OS, having used Redmi phones this is much more smooth and definitely OS wise this feels more premium+ Macro mode is just great with really indepth close object clicking+ Gaming and Frantic mode - This has been there in other phones as well but is worth a mention+ No heat up issues till now - Played Asphalt 9 and COD for 3+ continously but didn't heat up+ Super fast face detection and fingerprint sensorCons- Image stabilization while clicking pictures was an issue sometimes- Battery lasts about 14 hours but with such fast charging its a non issue for me- The camera notch but it gets solved as most of us put cases- Colour options are only 2- No Memory card slot with very high resolution clicks your memory will get over very soon, wpuld recommend you buy a 256 gb one for 2k more and not make the mistake I did- Earphones not included in the box. While I don't have much of a problem with removal of the 3.5 mm jack, it should at least be compensated with USB C or bluetooth headphonesFinally, the cons are not many and pros really outweigh them.Final rating - 4.5Verdict - Go for it, at 38k its a steal

5,"Packaging is cool and premium inserted with a small note. I bought the one with the higher storage capacity I.e 256gb. Only one colour (glacier blue) was available for this specification on Amazon.This was my first one plus phone and being an apple loyalist this phone has definitely struck the right chord in terms of user experience.Design: It’s a tad bit heavy on hands. Touch is extremely fluidic , responsive and as smooth as butter. The bottom rim of the phone has the speakers, sim and charging facility. Volume and power buttons are placed on the left and right side respectively. Extremely effortless even when used single handedly. There is no 3.5 mm jack but it's acceptable considering that the technology is inching towards wireless and earbuds era. Phone comes with pre-applied screen guard. Also the box contains a transparent back cover.Battery: Warp charging of 30w is just too quick and makes life easier. It hardly takes 15-20 mins to shoot up the charge by 40%.On a continuous usage of 3-4 hours video at 95% , capacity consumed was hardly 25% which is pleasing for long hours of video usage. Watching high resolution videos is a pleasure.Camera: one plus in general is know to have a good camera and this is no different. The pictures are crystal clear. Some pictures have been attached. Camera lens protrudes from the back which makes it prone to scratches from the surface.Night mode is excellent , pics come out with great clarity.Speakers are better than some of the premium smart phones in the market.A few improvements could be considered:-There is a slight lag in finger unlocking-Charger could have been lighter-Screen is prone to frequent dust accumulation even when placed in the interior and closed surroundings-Camera lens could have been flat- Type c connector could have been providedOverall this phone delivers top notch specifications in this price range and is a pleasure to own one. Last but not the least amazon delivery was extremely prompt with the delivery made within 24 hours.Update: 14/10: screen guard provided with the phone is not good as it is not scratch proof. I can already see a couple of them considering only regular touch to the display. It is recommended to change to a good tempered glass.

5,"Initially my first choice was to go for the rog phone 2 which had similar price pointsBut then I realized that paying money for the things which we are not going to use frequently is madness.Of course in specs the rog phone 2 looks like a heavyweight.But those are for the people who have never used one plus.First of all,I got my 7t on the Amazon's Great Indian festival which gave me a discount of 2000 RS which is equal to the rog phone 2(yes u get a discount for 2k but it was out of stock)Secondly, both phone's do not support sd card,since that I made one plus 7t my cup of tea.There is a difference between the 90hz and the 120hz display.But why pay for those if u are not a professional gamer.The camera on the 7t is way more good than the rog phone 2.The design is made for professionals and not gamers.Then comes the softwareOne plus 7t ships with Android 10 out of the box which is great.This is the first phone to get Android 10 even before the pixel 4.Then comes the battery lifeI have been using this phone for the past 5 days and I barely charge this device if I am using it at 60hz (that's smoother than the k20 pro).For 90hz display u will get a screen on time of around 6 if u are a regular user.For charging speeds, the 7t gets the wrap 30t which is insanely fast. It took me around 58 mins to charge the phone from 0-100 which is definitely the best in the market.Call quality and signal reception is good even when there is no proper signal reception on my brothers k20 pro.Face unlock is faster and the fingerprint reader is also improved.Oxygen 0s!!!!!! Belive me, If u switch to oxygen os,then clearly u will never back off .For a regular user who does gaming very often, the performance is top notch, the snapdragon 855 plus can handle anything at ease.Overall one plus has offered a complete packageFinally,I have no regrets in buying this phone over the rog phone 2........"
5,"Ladies and GentlemanPutting up this review after 1 week of rigorous use of the OnePlus 7T .Firstly, if you have the money and you want to invest in a decent flagship phone and tired of the vivos and MIs of the world...then your search ends here!Presenting 1+7t, the flagship premium phone presented to us by 1+Firstly to start off you are going to love the display...the 90Hz refresh is one beauty of a feature. Powered with sAMOLED display, this phone doesn't leave any stones unturned.It has a nice powereful 8gb RAM that does justice to the phone. In short its an iOS version of AndroidWrap30t powerful charging powers your phone to 70% in less than 30 mins and 100% in less than an hour. The charger is a bit bulky. But you are not going to carrry it all time with ur phone ;). the battery runs for about a day with mediun to high usage.Storage- if youare a heavy user with a lot of gaming and media content, go for the 256gb version. Else 128gb should do the job well.Enhanced features like Digital wellbeing, Zen mode helps u to measure ur screen time and achieve a good mobile-life balanceOxygenOS is smooth and this vomes with a perloaded Oxygen10 OS out of the box.Dolby Atmos surround sound works like a masterpiece. You wont need the full volume most of the times..Pls note- this phone does not have a 3.5mm audio jack. You got to buy a good decent type C to Aux converter OR simply just buy a good Bluetooth headset.The camera is lovely. Pictures are just perfect with the right color balance. Doesn't whitewash ur pix like the mid range phones. It can put up a good show against the latest iPhone variants.The finger print sensor is decent and does its job.The packaging is premium. It is a big box, All RED, with an invite letter, charger, back cover, some stickers.The phone comes with a preloaded glass protector and a premium case with all the cuts at the right places .Betwen 1+7 and 7t, if you are running low on budget and willing to compromise on the Triple camera setup, 30t charging, 90Hz display...Go for the base 1+7 variant.Between 1+7t and pro, go for 7t guys...as this is packed with a much advanced hardware.Guys also look for the 1+7t series launch on Oct 19 before evaluating.Hope you all enjoyed the review. Please hit the like button if this information was helpful.CheersFrom the 1+ Community"
5,"I replaced 3T with this masterpiece 7T. I had been using 3T for the last two and a half years and was planning to continue using it for another one or two years as 3T is still a beast as on date but unfortunately my 3T was dropped in a swimming pool and so i replaced my 3T with this amazing phone. When you are accustomed to using Oxygen OS nothing can replace the feeling and satisfaction. I have been using this 7T for last 3 days and i just want to give a quick overview of likes (which are many) and dislikes ( a very few) as below:Likes:1. Display is amazing with 90 hz refresh rate.2. Android 10 out of the box with new features.3. Excellent photos along with Supermacromode in camera.4. Zen mode with new customizable time periods.5. Butter smooth performance. No lagging or heating at all during multitasking or gaming.Dislikes:1. i am very dissappointed with the Nightscape mode. The picture you take in nightscape is unsatisfactory. Even though the camera manages to take the extra light but it lacks the originality and is less subtle especially when you snap a persons photo in very low light, its felt like colour mush evrywhere. Infact , to my surprise i found that low light photography is very good without using nightscape. Except this, i liked the camera quality very much.2. battery is average may be becoz of the 90 hz refresh rate for e.g on average to heavy usage if i start the day with 100% battery at 7 am , the phone manages to retain 10 to 20% battery by 7 to 8 pm.Anyways , overall i am very happy with the upgrade and glad to be a part of the one plus family again. infact in our family we have OP6, OP6T, OP7 and now OP7T ????????

5,"The experience with the OnePlus 7T is simply smooth and flawless. OnePlus have realised the difference a 90Hz panel makes, which is why they are including it on all their products. And you have to use it to believe it, a screen with 90Hz refresh rate is truly a joy to use (undoubtedly my favourite part of the phone). Coming to battery life, it easily lasts a day and a half for my usage but my usage is not that heavy. I only have to plug it in for 40 mins every morning before I go to work, nothing else ( charging speeds are INSANE). Lastly, as a person who is coming from a phone that was in a much lower price segment, I find the cameras to be more than adequate. However, if you truly want that top of the line camera experience, you may have to look at other flagships. We also know how quick and reliable OnePlus are with software updates and that is yet another great positive with this device. All in all, for 38K, I feel like OnePlus hit the nail on the head with this one. The phone is so slick and a joy to use on a day to day basis and comes with more or less all the bells and whistles you need.P.S: OnePlus is now offering 2 years warranty for models released including and after the 6T. So I guess that's peace of mind assured as well!"
5,Pros : 1. Premium design - all glass and metal build which looks awesome and feels very premium in hand.2. Oxyzen OS - it was the prime reason why I switched from poco F1 to OnePlus and it certainly didn't disappoint. Absolute joy to use this device due to clean and almost stock andriod experience with nice customisations.3. Speakers - The dual stereo speakers are of top notch quality and you will never use in maximum output and still it's more louder than other flagsip devices.4. 90 hertz refresh rate - Another deal maker is this utterly smooth 90 hertz refresh rate which is the best thing in OnePlus devises. Use it to believe it.5. Camera - Better than expected rear facing camera which produces crisp and detailed pictures in both daylight and lowlight conditions. Selfie camera are also good.6. Screen and sensors - The fluid amoled screen is just a treat for the eyes. All the sensors are working blazingly fast like fingerprint sensor and face unlock but missing the ir blaster.Cons: 1. Battery life - Battery life is not that great will last for a day in moderate use. But the warp charger will fill the juices blazingly fast so not a deal breaker.2. Camera bump- although the design is solid and cool but there is a slight tilt when u keep the phone in flat surfaces due to the camera bump.Overall an amazing and allrounder phone from OnePlus. Just close your eyes and buy if u want a premium device in mid range price.P.S. Purchased thru Amazon prime and got SBI disc of 2000.
5,"It’s awesome !! The phone is super smooth and there is no any lag and the camera is outstanding 38k is value for money and the display is super amazing. The camera quality is outstanding it has 2x optical zoom 10x digital zoom and the ultra wide angle is superb !! It works really well on low light with it's new nightscape feature which will optimize the image and gives you the best image in low light . I was really impressed by the video quality which has ultra wide angle support in video mode 2x zoom, 10x zoom , and it even has video stabilization which was really impressive all those mode can be shoot in 1080p 30 fps, and 4k 30 fps, but the ultra wide angle doesn't support in 1080p/ 60 fps, 4k 60 fps. But then I was surprised with 4k 60 fps which is ultra smooth just like iPhone 11 pro video quality. It has the best video quality in this range which no other companies will provide you with this amount of money . It has the best spec in such a low price as compared to other flagship phone . And the performance is on the next level with the combination on snapdragon 855 plus and 90 hz refresh rate and the front firing dual streo speaker with game space and fanatic mode takes gaming experience to the next level which you won't find such experience in any other smartphone in this price range . I wonder why a lot people complaint a lot about the battery when it does gives you decent average with 3800 mAh. I only need to charge for 30 min which gives me almost a day battery life . The charger is super amazing with the wrap 30t which insanely charge in no time . It only takes 54 min to fully charge from dead phone 0% to 100% which is super fast which I have never experienced in any other smartphone in this price segment . My video experience with this phone is incredible with the fluid amoled display it gives you immersive video experience and the dual front firing speaker is so loud and clear which gives the video experience to the next level . The indisplay fingerprint sensor the super . This is my honest review after 3 months of usage .

5,"I have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T"
5,"This is my first Oneplus phone and bought this after a looooot of research. Happy to realize that my choice wasn't bad. Yeah, if they release OP8 at a lesser price within next 2 months, it's gonna hurt, but that's the reality these days.Pros:1. Best camera in this range, hands down. There are no second questions as of now. Color profiles vary a little when you switch between cameras but I'm sure next update from oneplus will solve this.2. Fastest phone in this range. ROG 2 is another option but that's for gamers and is not a practical phone for most people.3. Display 90Hz is super fluid. It isn't quad HD unlike 7 pro or 7T pro. But this is the best in this price range.4. Software: Android 10 plus Oxygen OS. I bought this phone for this combo. Best as of now. Zen mode, night mode, reading mode, chromatic mode, greyscale mode, digital wellbeing, dark mode, the list goes on. You name it; this phone has it. Love it 3000.5. Speakers: Beast. Very loud and crisp.6. Design: 20:9 makes it easy to handle. Weight is balanced, can manage most stuff with one hand. Rear can design may be a problem for some. Camera bump isn't an issue at all since everyone is going to use a case. My Moto Z had similar bump, the case takes care of it.7. Battery: I wad skeptic about 3800mah plus 90Hz display combo. But this phone surprised me. Battery life is really good, easily 5.30 to 6hrs SOT depending on your usage in 90Hz. If you are traveling you can always switch to 60Hz for longer life. Plus the super amazing charger. I think few early reviews dint have the latest oxygen update which should have improved the battery life.Cons:1. No 3.5mm output.2. No type-c to 3.5mm converter or type-c headphones in the box: Oneplus could at least give people a 100rs converter for buying a 40k phone. Who wants the useless super fancy box right?3. No IR blaster.4. No notification LED.5. No ""always on"" display.6. No micro sd slot.I can't think of any other con. Will update if I find any.Adding some amazing night mode pics shot by both stock camera and gcam. All these pics were shot at 10PM.Battery screenshot: Dint play any games. Usage was mostly whatsapp, chrome, camera, and youtube. Dark Mode enabled. 90Hz enabled.Edit.Second screenshot: Includes 1hr 37 min pubg, 1hr 15min youtube. Single sim, wifi and 4g data always on, did not use GPS much.

5,"I am an iphone user since 2012, bought one plus 7t for my wife. She is avid android user and her 3t’s screen fell apart. So i bought ltest flagship for her.I dont care for refresh rate, huge screens specifications etc and my review is simply based on usability of phone. I use it for a whilw, make calls, check calender, watch netflix, use keyboard and judge it. if it doesnt hang its good to go. As simple as that.Pro’s- one plus has introduced gestures in place of generic 3 android buttons, gestures are just like iphone, swipe from bottom to close app, slide hold for multi tasker, slide left to right to go back and so on. Gestures were accurate. So kinda felt like using iphone.One plus has introduced cool animated wallpapers. They are really appealing.Back of phone is slight matte. Looks better than glossy back although a fingerprint magnet.Screen is good, a resolution of 1080pSpeakers are loud.Fluid and smooth.Good night mode and camera lightens selfies.Fast charging.Cons-Camera is ‘okayish’. Cant compare it with iphones camera at all. Although skin was lightened and night mode was good. (Compared to two years old iphone x)Gets slightly heat up during app updation.Size is really huge. Cant use it in single hand at all.Heavy.No headphone in the box.An android.So, if you are an android user, you should go for it. Good for next 3 years. Not much different from previously launched one plus phones."
5,"Oneplus always surpasses expectations as we all know. This phone is build so perfect and beautiful, my iphone user friends are even jealous with the design and make.Pros:# beautifully premium design with glass back and matte but metallic looking glacier finish. I dont like motorised parts like in reno or 7pro design, feel unsafe to me.# processor os ultra fast, finger print reader is fastest i know of, screen is mesmerising though i feel a very little difference as compared to my samsung s7 edge screen, refresh rate i dont know how to make out difference, so no point there tbh.# price rnage is okkay. Not pricey not cheap.# battery life is awesome, considering 90hz refresh rate and samoled display with 855+ processor.# everything else u cna think about is pros only.Cons:# gboard google keyboard is okayish as compared to apple and samsung keyboards, im getting misclicks and misspelled words, accuracy is too much i think, apple has so much optimised keyboards, so does samsung, i think oneplus and google will work on it.# camera performace is just fine in low light tbh, apple 11 will surely shot better pics in low light i think.# i hv watched on youtube about life of back glass, they said it is prone to develop scratches over time, i dont know though, lets see.# headfone jack was removed. My heart broke, its not a good movement, we have senheiser and all 3.5mm headfone jacks, why r u removing these guys, its basic thing, shifting from micro usb to type c usb plug is different thing, but this is not at all fair, we are forced to buy third party connectors which practically ruins the atmos effects, many of us dont like wireless. Thumb down here. As a gesture of goodwill you could provide connector in the box at least, yeah its not there in the box, buy from outside.# no colour option for 256gb version as of now, only glacier blue, not a big issue, but its a bit funky. Not like like for everyone."
5,"Review after ine week of usuage:-Design: The design is gorgeous with glacier blue colour having a gradient finish on the back. The camera module is somewhat a personal prefercence but in 2019 with all phones looking exactly same from back side it does give it a different look. Personally i really like the camera island type design.Screen: The screen is full hd amoled 90hz refresh rate screen. Its again gorgesous to look at,media content looks amazing,and once u start using 90hz refresh rate its dificult to go back to normal 60hz refresh rate. Its something which can be experience d and cant be explained.Camera : The triple camera set up does the job, the main sensor is 48mp sensor which takes great shots in daylight/natural light, ultrawide lens is great for taking wider view and is a superb addition to main camera. Portrait shots have good depth and does a good job at separating object with the background. The best feature has to be the macro mode,it takes some great macro shots ,with subject as close as two inches, all the food bloggers will love this feature .Performance: Fast, performance is just fast ,u throw anything at it it just doesnt lag, multitasking is butter smooth.Battery : battery is decent ,gets almost one full day around 15-17hrs at heavy usuage. But charging is super fast,plug in and u get 0-70 in almost half hour.Over all at this price point ,this phone has top notch specs,and delivers the performace thats expected out of it.Only Asus Rog phone 2 is near and in some cases better than this phone at this orice,but dats a game centric phone and may be not everyones cup of tea.Last words: If u are in market for a new one,under 40k price bracket and want all the flagship features ,great performace and software experience and all round performibg camera...Do go for this phone !!!!

5,"Love the forested silver color.! Display is just awesome, the finger print scanner and the face unlock combo is so fast that It feels instantaneous on press of the power button, camera and picture quality could be even more better which I hope will be taken care of in upcoming updates, performance wise it's a beast once you enable the developers option and change the animation to 0.5X scale the phone just blazes through, getting solid one day battery after 6.3hrs of gaming(call of duty, pubg), lots of browsing and songs(video) and no heating issues yet, though I doubt it has the cooling unit like oneplus 7 and oneplus 7 pro and oneplus 7t pro. The speakers are way too loud which is a good thing for movies, games and songs, bad thing that even the earpiece at the lowest level of volume is loud enough that the person next to you can hear the conversation pretty accurately in an office or silent environment. Best buy for the money needless to upgrade to oneplus 7t pro and oneplus pro just for the pop-up camera(which can be annoying when you have have face unlock enabled as it will pop up every single time you try to unlock the phone eventually will worn-out the motor lot faster) and higher display resolutions which saves loads of money. Fastest charging I have ever seen. And hardwares specs are all upto the current trend that you don't have to even think of upgrading your phone for a very long time."
5,"POSITIVES.- Display is phenomenal. 90hz display is really outstanding. It is very bright and its the best I have used till date.- Design is awesome. Build looks solid. Colour is beautiful. No issues here since i like the camera setup (& bump) & teardrop notch.- Sound is very good. I love it.- Fingerprint unlock is super fast and had never failed till now. Face unlock is even better.- CAMERA is awesome so far. I like the micromode, nightscape, ultrawide & slow motion. They all take beautiful pics & videos. Sometimes, when its too dark, nightscape lets in too much red & blue light. But, thats minor issue. Overall, enjoying the camera so far. Its a treat.- Call quality is superb.- Included case & screen guard are of very good quality.- CHARGING. Its amazing how less time it takes to charge up fully. Battery lasts a full day easily even after using it pretty heavily..- Oxygen OS is pretty neat and fast. Getting updates regularly. Gestures & customizations are pretty solid.NEGATIVES.- I feel my phone heats up every now & then. Might have heating issues. But, not sure since I used it for only few days now. Im overusing it since its a new mobile. Lets see how it goes.- They should have included headphones of some kind. Or at least that USB C headphone pin.I'd give it a 5/5 since the positives trumps the very few negatives i have/having. Im planning to use the mobile for atleast 3 years. Hope it serves me better."
5,"Design – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in

5,"My two primary drivers before this was the Poco f1 and the Nokia 7plus. So my comparision will primarily be with these two.Performance: One word - snappy !Display: Gorgeous. 90hz refresh rate is clearly noticeable.Battery: Now this is the most criticised aspect of the phone , well let me tell u it is NOT Bad at all ! Believe it or not I got 5+ hrs screen on time with 38% remaining , yes u read that right ! Can't believe it ?! Lol i have screenshot of the battery usage , see it for yourself. So technically I could have easily churned out 8hrs or more screen on time if i had used it till 5% battery. What is confusing is almost every reviewer on YouTube or even user reviews have quoted a maximum of 5.5 hrs SOT at max. Now let me share some tips which i feel might helped in my case , when i first setup my phone i was to migrate my data n apps from old phone. But i did not copy the nearly 100apps i had in my nokia 7 plus , instead i just copied the contacts and messages n synced other settings with Google account. I then clean installed all the apps that i use on a regular basis i.e some 20 odd apps. I am not sure but i feel this could have helped in improving the battery life. I always keep my location off n 4g data always on + wifi when available.Camera: Now most people compare this phone n it's camera with Apple , Google , samsung flagships but fail to understand that those phones cost almost double that of this phone ! The camera takes brilliant pics in good light , low light any lighting condition u throw at it. This camera is a lot good when viewed in isolation n it is only a lil bit inferior when compared side by side with iphone 11 or pixel 3/4 , also u get wide angle camera which is missing on pixel. The camera is more than good enough for social media uploads.Conclusion: Best phone overall n VFM by a mile. If u game a lot then get ROG 2 because that has a bigger battery but as an everyday driver for normal usage this is best !

5,"I am using this phone from last one week. My experience is Fantastic.1. Looks is great. It looks Amazing in hand.2. Colour is good. A little bit downside from the 7.3. Screen - Best in category. At 90HZ it just feel amazing to touch it and scroll trough it. Its smooth and vibrant. You have to use it to feel it.4. Camera - great. Improved from the older one due to improve hardware. Still some improvement required and I thick Oneplus will do it through patch. I have tool some pictures in different condition and Image production is Great. I really loved the macro mode. Still not the top notch but one of the best produced by Oneplus.5. Speaker - Dolby sound. Sound through speaker is good even at high end.6. Battery - Good back up but it may be improved in future models. When you have phone with 90HZ then it will drain the battery fact, hence more battery power is required. Once plus should have used 4100mAH battery. But still one charges is enough for one day. And you also have Warp Charger and it is faster than the Dash. So not to worry about it.7. Processor - Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+. It works very smooth. Multitasking is easy with it. With new GPU, it work well for all Games. You can play any Game without any lag.So, overall the best phone of 2019...You should buy it without any hesitation...You will not be disappointed."
5,"OnePlus 7T:I rarely change mobile phones only when and if it is required. My average mobile lasts me 3-5 years before I change one.I opted to go for 7T this time. My review for past one week is :Design- I believe this is purely based on personal preference. For me I really like the overall design and color. It does not feel cheap and has premium feel to it.Display: The is display is a gem and feast to the eyes while at 90hz. The games work smoothly and the touch response is really good. My eyes do not feel strained and you also get the option to change it to 60hz to save battery. If coming from a layman's perspective you will even enjoy the 60hz display just because the display is Crystal clear.-DC Dimmimg is addition feature which the OnePlus has added to avoid screen flicker at low brightness and some of the users have been still facing the issue. From my personal experience I did not face any of such issues and the feature worked flawlessly. I believe this is more of certain product issue and this is something which OnePlus needs to address. If they don't mean to settle just like their OnePlus 7 range then they need to address this issue.Camera: Camera works flawlessly. However, Some people liked the camera bump on 7T and some didn't. Personally, I don't mind till the time it serves it's purpose. Just need to take a bit care of it. You will enjoy clicking pictures from this camera. The macro lens provides a very good perspective while clicking the pictures. Although, I feel the camera does make the pictures a little warmer. The nightscape mode provides a clear pictures at night. However, I think it could have been better. The pictures could also have been a little more sharper.Overall pretty good camera.UI: It works flawlessly with regular updates. Yes, I already got one within a week of owning it. Nothing more to say here.Fingerprint reader: One of the fastest scanner I have come across with multiple animated options to choose from.Overall- 4/5I'm enjoying using this phone and I have been appreciating the thought process gone though everything while making this device to provide such a beast.-No heating issue. Fnatic mode, Gaming mode works efficiently. All the games including COD, PUBG, Asphalt, Temple Run work brilliantly at Max settings.***Also you get the back cover and screen protector with it. If there is any update on regards to the over all functioning of the device then I will make sure to update it over here."
5,"I have been using a Samsung Galaxy S8 for the last 2 years and switched to the OnePlus 7t 256 GB a couple of weeks ago. My feedback based on the 2 weeks of rigorous use vis-à-vis the Galaxy S8 –Pros:- Amazing 30w Warp Charge is the fastest I have seen. My rigorous use means I need a big battery and being a Samsung loyalist had considered the M30s. However, the sub par specs other than that massive battery on the M30s meant I went for the 7t and I am happy that I chose this.- The finger print sensor is much better than the Samsung S8 and the haptics are also quite good. Overall the cell phone also feels faster than the S8 in day to day usage and the data access is also visibly faster.- One grouse I always had with the S8 was that the speaker loudness whether on a phone call or listening to the single speaker was terrible for a flagship phone. By comparison the stereo speakers of the 7t are brilliant. I actually have to turn down the speakers listening to YouTube videos it is that loud.- The box comes with the fantastic warp charger and surprise, surprise a basic transparent case. I purchased a more robust case as I am prone to dropping my phones but it is a nice gesture by OnePlus. The idiots should probably have included a USB C to 3.5mm jack as well but then there’s no end to asking for freebies.Cons:- The biggest negative is the screen quality. I don’t mind the 1080p resolution as I also ran my S8 in 1080p to save battery. The problem is that the 7t screen never feels vibrant like the S8 despite adjustments. The back lighting is inconsistent and feels patchy. And for some reason, the Auto backlight adjustment seems to always set up the screen darker than it should. In summary, nothing comes close to a Samsung AMOLED.- Another aspect of the screen that bugs me is that the oleo phobic coating on the screen or rather the pre applied screen guard is terrible. The screen always looks dirty as compared the superb black mirror look of my Samsung S8.- The reason I almost didn’t purchase the 7t was that it offers no SD Card support. I did opt for the larger 256 GB variant but I would still prefer the choice of putting in my own micros SD. I also don’t like the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack but that doesn’t affect me much. I have shifted to the Jabra 65t Elite BT headphones for everyday work. I use a Dragonfly Red DAC with OneMore Quad Drivers for music listening on flights.- Using the phone over a 40 minutes drive with Android Auto I found the phone heating up. Samsung S8 never had this issue because Samsung is extra cautious about heat management after the exploding Notes episode.So far so good with the OnePlus 7t. It is superb value as compared to the Samsung S10 range. The S10e that has specs at par with the S8 of nearly 3 years ago is a rip off at 50k+ and the other S10 phones are daylight robbery of even greater magnitudes.Simply put, I take my phone selection very seriously and frankly there seems to be no phone that can offer better value and user experience at this price range."
5,"Here's an honest review of the OnePlus 7T.Want a best phone under 40k go for this one without thinking twice. I'm saying this because i have literally researched every other phone falling under this category i.e., the ?40000 bar.Pros1. Great display. Seriously awesome display vivid colours and great brightness outdoors plus its a flat screen which is a big thumbs up coz I'm not really into curved displays for however pleasing they may look but in practicality not to good.2. Battery. Battery life is just marvelous. Lasts for me about a whole day doing normal usage and 6-7 hours of heavy usage.Also Warp charge is just plain Awesome. Takes about 45 min to fully charge from 10-15%.3. Sound. Dual stereo speakers are just great. Immersive sound experience. Loud and clear4. Oxygen OS It is the best there is without any doubt. Better than samsung one ui or any other.5. Camera Triple camera system is really good. Wide angle is 117° so a little short than other wide angles which are 120° but doesn't make any difference. Great pictures and videos.The macro shot is just great. Indoor and outdoor clicks are good. If your thinking iphone comparable quality just don't but is great for its price. Wouldn't regret buying it.Cons1. Minor bugs here and there that can be fixed with updates which is what OnePlus is good at.Updates are frequent and shows that they work really hard at this.2. Some people won't like the circular camera system so I'm writing in the cons but its just a matter of personal view. It doesn't bother you with anything.3. No 3.5 mm to type-c connector in the box.4. Some won't like the plastic TPU case but that's what you get.Anyhow it is the best phone there is right now better than OnePlus 7 pro and 7T pro actually.So no need to worry just go for it.If any questions just ask.If you are missing headphone jack buy a Bluetooth headset. I would recommend Sony WI400. 15 hrs battery. 1 hour charging time with warp charger ofcourse and pretty good range. Also great base and awesome sound. Priced at ?3500."
5,"This is my first OnePlus device. My cousins have been using OnePlus phones (OnePlus 3 and 5T) since a long time. I was previously using the Redmi Note 4 so the jump to OnePlus was quite a big one for me. From using an entry level phone to buying a Flagship, it was a giant leap. Got great discount on this phone (?3600 off for exchanging Redmi Note 4 and ?1700 off on ICICI card). I got the phone on 16th of October and have been using the phone ever since. I'll divide my review between the pros and consPROS:-1. BATTERY LIFE. It may seem weird but somehow because of OnePlus's optimizations, I'm getting a SOT of around 6.5-7 hours. If you really try to kill the battery, then also you'd get a SOT of atleast 5 hours2. PERFORMANCE. This phone absolutely flies. The SD855+ processor is a multitasking beast. No stuttering or lags whatsoever3. RAM MANAGEMENT. The RAM management on this phone is insanely good. Apps never get refreshed. Just don't enable the RAM Boost option in settings4. CAMERA. The cameras on this phone are great. Daytime photos look good with slightly increased contrast. The nightscape mode is just too good. Better than Pixels in my opinion. The Super Stable Video mode is a godsend5. SOUND QUALITY. The stereo speakers on this phone are extremely loud and clear. Dolby Atmos really works6. HAPTICS. The vibration motor on this phone is really awesome. Crisp and Precise7. CHARGING. This phone charges at a crazy fast rate. I get 0-71% in half an hour and 0-100% in 55 minutes8. DISPLAY. That 90hz refresh rate is silky smooth. You won't go back to 60hz again. Every other phone with 60hz refresh rate (iPhone, Note 10+, Pixel 3 XL, Mate 30 Pro etc) feels laggy after using this phone.CONS:-1. SYSTEM STABILITY. There are a few bugs here. The brightness wouldn't go to full even after you have set it to max. It'll take 1-2 seconds extra to go to full brightness. Sometimes, Chrome freezes on its own.2. NO USB-C TO 3.5MM DONGLE IN BOX3. NO EARPHONES IN BOXMISCELLANEOUS:-1. The screen flickers at low brightness. Not a hardware issue. It's the nature of OLED displays. You can't see it with your naked eyes but a camera can pick it up. If it bothers you, enable the DC Dimming feature2. AMOLED displays have a hard time displaying correct images on a dark grey background under low brightness. So no need to panic if you see some reddish or greenish tint on a grey backgroundOverall, This is an awesome phone. No phone is perfect. Each phone has a few bugs. I have already got 2 software updates regarding system stability and camera quality. OnePlus is known to remove all bugs from their phones through software updates so no need to worry if you find some bugs.

5,"Over the last 15 years of using phones, I have spent a good part of my last decade- life & earnings on IPhones. Except for Iphone 5, I’ve had all models until my last one which was the Iphone 8plus. There was a brief period when Samsung (S6) grabbed my attention and it served me well, however the bloatware got the best of me before I switched back to IOS.Iphone 8 Plus was with me for over 18 months and the charm had worn off- it had started slowing down to a point where one could really notice it. I know, change the battery, do a factory reset & get another 18 months out of it, but I was just too lazy to do all of that. Spending lots of money on a new Iphone when there was nothing new on offer did not make sense for me. Specifically, the option of only face unlock and even worse was the speed of unlocking the phone. After playing around from various phones within friends & family:Enter One plus 7T-Pros:- Premium build & exudes quality. I got the Blue version- Charging speed- It’s a miracle!! ~30% to 100% by the time I finish my shower & breakfast- Speed- Multi tasking is a joy, never had a single instance of phone hanging or an app crashing (Side note- Android apps have really become stable from 5 years ago)- Screen is really impressive- Bright, vivid & I love the color saturation (this is a personal choice)- Dual sim- now I carry just one phone- Connectivity- Wifi & Mobile Network are better than I experienced on my older 8Plus- Camera- Debatable, they are not the best nor the worst. Colors can appear unnatural at times. I prefer Iphone 11 on this one, but much better than Samsung S9 or older Iphones- Customization options are unlimited- Fancy for me- In screen Fingerprint scanner - as fast as any normal oneCons:- Battery- Let’s be clear. I am a heavy user with office mails synced on phone. This lasts the work day, but I won’t be confident to go out for tipple after work without a short boost. But this was the case with my 8 Plus too, except I now need just 15 mins to charge and not an hour like before. Not a deal breaker for me- Battery- Update after few days of usage. Switch to 60hz display, turn off wifi/BT when not in use and it actually lasts much longer. But 60Hz is not fun once you have used 90Hz- No 3.5 mm, but they could’ve given the convertor- It’s a pain to get tempered glass or back cover from local shops. Guess this will change soon with more phones coming to the market"

5,"I've been using it for a while now. Absolutely f****ing glad i purchased this. It has its cons, but whatever it does well, it does mindblowingly well. So much here that has been done to perfection.Pros:1- Display is so good its unreal. After using 90hz you'll never want to go back to 60 hz again. Infact I find 60hz phones quite unusable now. Colors are awesome too. It's not curved like OnePlus 7 Pro, so it doesn't have the issue of accidental touches and inputs from your palm that curved screens have. On top of that it won't break as easily and curved glass on any accidental falls and It'll also cost a LOT less if you happen to break it than a curved glass would.The brightness is excessive. To the point where there is no need to have it above 75% brightness in any situation, even outdoors. This means even outdoors in sunlight you'll have a good viewing experience and STILL be below the maximum brightness possible in this phone.2- Camera is amazing. Macro shots and nightscape will blow your mind. Wide angle lens does a good job too.3- Oxygen OS is arguably the ONLY version of Android that is better than stock (it's debatable, but I stand by this statement) . The OS is a huge selling point alone.4 - The charging again, blows my mind. I usually don't charge overnight. I wake up, keep it on charge till I take a shower and have my breakfast. When I'm back 45 mins later, it's almost always fully charged. That is absolutely nuts.Cons:1- There is no headphone jack. Although you can buy an adapter for pretty cheap on the oneplus site itself. Still jumping a few extra hoops to use my Earphones is a con for sure. And Bluetooth Earphones just aren't on the same level as wired ones (audio output wise) unless you're willing to shell out upwards of 5k.2- Battery surely isn't nearly as bad as people in the comment section seem to be saying it is. But it's still pretty average. It'll last you the day, but no more than that. This isn't that huge a con bexuase as I said, battery isn't bad, it's just not anything special. And secondly, the warp charge can get half your battery back in 25 mins or so, so the actual capacity means very little when you have that as far as real world usage is concerned.

5,"Was looking for a phone with multiple lenses, with good battery and if possible stereo speakers... Had a Galaxy S8 which was still going good but was lacking in the battery department. OnePlus 7 pro seemed to match my requirements but also seemed to be quite big and unwieldy. During the festive sale was keen to get the Mate 20 pro, when the 7t landed right in the middle of my already split decision making . It came with solid medicore triple camera setup, macro modes , fast charge tech and 90 hz display which all seemed to add up. Have been using it for a month now !PROS1. Enjoy the stereo speakers setup2. Fast charging which seem to match OnePlus' claim3. The display, just gorgeous to view content4. Camera- good setup and hope to have future improvements. Nowhere near the performance of the phones which cost double of this but quite acceptable at this price range.CONS1. Battery- with 90hz and data on am able to go a full 24 hours of usage with screen on time of around 4 to 5 hours . With 90hz and on wifi can get up to 7- 8.5 hours of SOT. Frankly my expectations were more(1.5 days of battery life) and this did not match up to that . Also after installing a lot of apps the idle drain also seems to be more around 0.8 to 1% per hour2. HEADPHONE JACK- I miss this a lot. Have the 1000xm3s so using that a lot but otherwise the adapter setup is kind of very inconvenient3. The PRO mode is very iffy with access only to the primary camera4. Coming from a Samsung phone with so many different features missed things like one handed mode and popping out apps into resizable windowsOverall enjoying the experience!"
5,"They say ""good things come in small packages"", and most rightly so, this product does full justice to this adage.1. Resolution and Screen Quality is top notch.2. Fingerrprint Reader is awesome and extremely responsive and fast3. Camera Quality is one of the bestin the One Plus line up. Macro mode is an icing on the cake,4. 90Hz Display is not a feature but an experience which you will only feel once you use the app drawer and the OS5. Oxygen OS -android 10 -out of the box with regular updates .6. No lags , No stutters.7. Awesome RAM management and fluid app switches.8. Ergonomics of the phone has been improved as compared to 79. OK Battery backup. Nothing great but charging is super fast10. WARP CHARGE 30T technology which juices up the phone is less than an hour.11. Loud stereo sound and perfect for audiophiles12.Type C usb and 256 gb internal storage.13. The back panel is smoother than a baby's bum.CONS_1. Hideous camera design. This is subjective though. They could have kept a horizontal or vertical module. But i got no complaints since i got used to it and the camera quality is quite a stunner. Please dont expect IPHONE results - each brand has its own strengths and weaknesses.2. This phone is perfect for gaming as well but then you would have to put it on charge because the battery backup isnt like the ROG series. But i aint a gamer so i dont care.3. No headphone jack. Type C usb , so only one charging port to be shared with type c earphones. Additonal kharcha if u dont own one.4.FHD+ AND NOT QHD PANEL - WHY ONE PLUS WHY?5. Gorilla Glass 5 and not 6 - this is sheer cost cutting.All in all - if i dont nitpick , i am very satisfied with this device. Its a beast and a perfect phone for mid to heav usage. This phone has removed all the flaws of its predecessors ,esp the large notch of the one plus 7 and stupid depth sensor and one additonal camera.GO FOR IT BLINDLY.A"
5,"First of all thanks to Amazon for there quick delivery within 24 hours along with exiciting exchange offers. Thank you Amazon!The product was delivered in a unique sealed tamper proof bag with a unique ID for your security.Coming back to the product, it's a swashbuckling deal adding all the discounts along with exchange price at just ?31700!Pros:1. 3 rear cameras with 1 being the main camera, other two for wide angle and close up shots. You will enjoy photography at night (low light) photography too with this device.2. 90hz refresh rate with fluid amoled display.3. 855+ processor makes the device buttery smooth.4. Inbuilt ram boost management.5. Fast face unlock6. Comes with protective case with cushioned corners that protects your screen even if it drops from 2-3 feets. It also protects the bumpy camera.7. Warp charging with 100% charging within 1hour 10 minutes.8. Alert slider for changing profile modes.9. Extended 1 year warranty on registering the product on one plus care. You can also refer your friends and earn points to redeem.Cons:1. No headphone jack, you have to buy a connector or OnePlus bullet headphones seperately.2. Fingerprint reader is bit of a issue since it doesn't work properly 10-20% of the time.3. Gets heatedto some extent on contunuous usage (depends on what application you are using though).4. Battery life is not the best if you are a hardcore gamer, however it's get along well for a normal daily usage at 60hz refresh rate lasting for more than a day.Conclusion:A great device for daily normal usage, clicking really snappy photos, for an enhanced viewing experience. Only if you want a better battery life with a bezel less design (not even a notch) and a better ram management you can think of going for OnePlus 7T pro by spending that extra 16k. Nevertheless it's a great buy, worth every penny!And now if you are in a dilemma whether to wait for Rog Phone 2 or not, my suggestion would be only go for that if you are into hardcore gaming almost for 12*7. Otherwise it's not available in stock all the time and flipkart doesn't provide great exchange offers along with Asus like OnePlus does in different festivals like diwali, and i hope in upcoming Christmas also they will be providing the extra discount facility in exchange of phones. OnePlus has a referral program on various occasions that gives you extra 2k off and adding to that different bank offers makes OnePlus the best buy over Rog phone 2, since both are priced at the ?37,999 (base variant).Hope this review will help all the reader's, peace out! ????

5,"OnePlus started it's series as the flagship/Nexus killer with the OnePlus Oneand now it has become the flagship. Except few hiccups like OnePlus 2 and OnePlus X, OnePlus has had a good run. OnePlus 7T is just another addition to its good phone list.This review is after almost two months of usage so will cover mostly all that people actually care about as a general user.1. Design is a very subjective opinion and depends on a person's taste. Personally, I'm not a fan of the circular camera but won't rate it as bad. However, the back panel is quite slippery and a fingerprint magnet so would suggest to go with a case.2. Display on 7T has followed the upgrade of OnePlus 7 Pro. 90 Hz is quite smooth but it isn't something which general users will care for in the long run. I still prefer the 1080p panel over 2K. The higher screen resolutions are just battery drainers and don't add quite much to the experience in my opinion. The screen is quite slim and tall which makes the phone a bit bigger for use. The waterdrop notch doesnt ruin the experience as such.3. Battery life wasn't upto the mark when I first received the phone and gave me mere 4-4.5 hours SOT which was quite disappointing from a newly purchased phone. However, the situation changed after I visited the service center and they reinstalled the OS to what came with the phone i.e. 10.0.4 and after which I updated it to 10.0.6. Since then battery has been really great. I have been getting 7+ hours of SOT on normal usage and around 6 hours with one hour of PUBG. After this tweak, the 30T warp charge does look like a bonus. I believe the 10.0.5 update which we received after getting the phone was somehow the culprit behind the battery drain.4. Camera has given me some mixed results. Not bad but not great either. Previously on my OnePlus 6T, the Gcam was doing a great job but since we haven't received a perfect Gcam for 7T yet, the stock camera is the better option to go and it clicks quite decent photos.5. Android: Before switching to OnePlus device, I was a Nexus user and I was quite used to the stock android experience. OnePlus provides just that with few extra tweaks which doesn't ruin the stock experience. They provide quite regular updates on their Oxygen OS which is quite commendable.Overall, OnePlus 7T is quite a great phone and can be recommended except that it'll get old in just six months. If you are looking for a new phone and this phone is on your mind, then you should go for it.There is one problem with the WiFi which I have noticed is that Wifi faces drops when connected to 5 ghz on some routers. It works perfectly fine on 2.4 ghz channel though."
5,"I took the phone in the last week of November and got the 128 gb variant for 35k.The delivery was fast and the phone was delivered in good shape.It is pretty much what you would expect from OnePlus. The build is pretty premium. Comes with a transparent case inside. The buttons and screen are sturdy looking although the back and screen do attract fingerprints.The performance on this thing is flawless and is just a bit ahead of the rog2 even though the rog2 beats it in almost every other field. The 90 hertz display combined with the 855+ really defines a new standard of being smooth.Updates are timely and the oxygen OS is the standard vanilla experience although i found the unnecessary Netflix app pre-installed.Fingerprint reader is pretty quick and the camera is good too although the camera gives images slightly on the saturated side.The notch is not much of an issue.The biggest bummer is the lack of an audio jack which i think was a bad move from OP. The phone does not come with a 3.5mm adapter and you will have to buy it seperately. Although the mrp of the adapter is 390, you can enroll your device with your OP Account and get 250 off on it. I got mine for 180. It's not the most comfortable thing to use and does not have a good build quality but haven't gotten any issues yet.This packs a 3800mah battery which combined with the 90hertz display drains reasonably fast. If you don't use your phone a lot during the day it does last for a day and a half but if your screen is continuously on then will just last a day.With complete day on YouTube at 30% i had got 7 hrs of screen on time.But this won't be an issue for you if you can carry the charger. The 30watt wrapt charge is ridiculously fast. It charges from 30 to full in a little over 35 mins. Even a 10 min charge gives me around 30%.One charge in the morning for me lasts till the next day morning with 20-30% to spare.So only pick this phone if you are taking it for long use and for the snappy clean software and performance.If you are planning to take a phone for gaming choose the rog2 over it anyday. Not that it performs better than this. The performance is almost the same but it has a ton more of other features that will matter more.Overall it's a good phone."
5,"Review after 2 months of use, and be sure its not a paid one-This is my first OP device from MOTO to OP was a bit difficult while you are addicted to Stock Android, but OP7T surprised me in a positive manner.Pros-1. Maybe there are criticism about its camera bump or looks, we all know it doesn't matter at the end of the day. Its screen to body aspect ratio and form factor is so premium.2. Finger print, face unlock is fast and reliable in 95% cases. A bit miss in finger print can be observed.3. Screen is fluid and OS of the device makes it crispy. You can customise as per your taste.4. Speaker is a hit on the device. I was a bit surprised after its awesome and nice sound quality. Dual speaker is not a gimmick here. It actually have a separate speaker on front for loud sound ( knows from teardown video).5. OS is so much easy to use. As I was a stock user for last two devices, its just enhance the experience. Customised and very very useful features are on plate. We barely need an extra app to keep day to day need. One thing for sure, 'One plus do care about your experience, already got 6 updates and bug fix. 7th one is on air by now'. So you never feel left out.6. Last but not the least, CAMERA. Its a beast in this segment. There is a catch in this case. Its definitely not a point and shoot camera. You have to wait and find best possible mode to capture your story. Main camera is awesome and ultimately stabilise your hand movements thanks to OIS+EIS. 2x telephoto is too cool, best use in portrait mode and super macro mode. Wide angle is useful and cool one. In a nutshell, three cameras are not gimmick, those are actually in use in different mode. NIGHTSCAPE is a catch in the device. Super pleased with its capture.There you come to pro mode, and it can seriously produce a DSLR like photo, but surely not in point and shoot mode. You need a shere knowledge to capture.7. Charging is blazing fast and reliable.8. Battery is a bit miss but you have to wait till device AI kicks in. Battery optimisation updates is on plate. You can juice it up in 30 min max. A decent backup for mid range users.9. Gaming mode is champ here. Noise free and fluid experience. Enable fanatic mode and there you go. Enjoy with the beast. Awesome ram management and super fast loading combination with fluid display surely gonna make you fan of this device.10. There kicks in GOOGLE DIGITAL WELLBEING. Surely if you want to suppress your phone addiction. Its a super helpful feature.Maybe you heard it right, this device is capable for Google AR Core. You can enjoy AR gaming nad features with it.Cons:1. Bugs in software. Its may not be prominent but you can feel it while use.2. Camera is not that point and shoot good. You need to capture at best possible combo. Luckily all of the modes are pre installed there.3. Battery is disappointing on its value. You have 8 gb ram, amoled screen with 90hz refresh rate. Now you need the juice to fuel the beast. Its decent but not catch-up the mark. Decent backup you can expect.4. Headphone jack. Surely its a choice but not proving an adopter in the box, is a miss.5. Device comes with a GG5 but I recommend a screen protector and case on this part. Back is finger print magnet. Camera glass may attract scratch.

5,"I am giving this review after using my Oneplus 7T for about 15 days. Since now I have not faced any lag issue or app crashing issue. Below are some detailed features I want to mention.#OxygenOS and Fnatic mode : The main advantage of this phone is smoother experience with the 90hz display and Oxygen OS. It runs on the latest Android 10 version. The Gaming mode and the special Fnatic mode is very useful for me. It activats advanced DND mode and blocks calls, notifications, messages and enhances the RAM , CPU and GPU and also enhances the network speed.#Battery life:The bettery life is not that bad or good, but average. For me as a student it lasts about oneday for a single charge . I can play a full game of PUBG mobile on this divice and it drains only 12-16% battery . But the charging speed with the Wrap 30T is insanely fast. It almost charges my phone from 15% to 80-85% in almost half an hour. If you continuously watch youtube videos , it will give you about 7-8 hour of backup in 90hz , which is great I think. If you want more battery backup you can use it in 60hz.#Camera quality:I don't think i need to say about that. You can check the photos i have taken . The low light mode is awesome.. And a super awesome feature is the supermacro mode. It can focus objects near to the camera of about 2-3 cms. The pro mode is really awesome, which allows you to shoot photos in different ways. I have to still explore the various camera mode options ????. Many people don't like the camera bump and the round camera design. I was also one of them but after using for 5-7 days I am used to it and now I don't feel bad about it.#Sound quality:Sound quality is also good compared to the previous edition (OP 6) of my friend. Now it comes with dynamic sound quality with Dolby Atmos.#Warrenty and updates:Oneplus gives android updates for about 2 years and security patch updates for 3 years . I have got 1 year warrenty . Then i got complementary 1 year warrenty extension by downloading OnePlus care app and registering my IMEI ID no. Overall I got 2 years of warrenty."
5,"Display- 90hz is smooth- decent 1080p OLED- visible outdoors- rating 4.8/5.Design- pretty slim and sexy- small notch on display almost bazless, flat design.- ugly camera bump ( i hate it )- rating 4/5Performance- SOS 855 plus with 8 GB ram its really smooth as u expect- plus that 90 hz screen really helps to smooth things out.- rating 5/5 ( duh)OS- clean android OS with some additional features which are really helpful and will stay away if u dont wanna use them.- i personally think that oneplus does andriod better than google without its 1000$ price tag.- freq updates- rating 5/5Camera- exellent day light photos ( on par with best of 1000$ flagships)- night mode is also great ( i will say 70% compared to best out there.)- good dyanmic range, contrast colors- videos are also good at 4k 60 fps.- macro mode is way more fun- rating 4/5Battery Life- i am a light to med user and it lasts me whole day with 30-40 % left. ( 90 hz all the time )- warp charging is insanely fast 0-75% in 30 mins.- compared to my OP 3 its better, even at 90hz all the time.- rating 4.5/5final wordsits an awesome phone, if u want the notch less display then go for 7 pro which costs lil bit more than 7t.but oneplus did it again, bang for bucks."
5,"This is the fastest phone I've ever laid my hands on. I never thought speed would make such a difference. Mid range phones are very good these days making flagship phones less attractive. But this phone is just so fast, it makes all that extra money you put in worthwhile. This phone will be good for 3 years easily just because of the specs and power. You can directly upgrade from this phone to a good foldable in 3 years. Stock camera disappoints sometimes in certain scenarios but gcam comes to the rescue. You cannot blindly open the stock cam in an urgent situation. Keep both and use whichever you think will suit the situation. That's the only minor problem with this phone. Also the fingerprint reader isn't perfect. I suggest registering each of your fingers twice to improve results. Otherwise everything is perfect. Screen ,battery life, performance, speakers, charging speed, UI, in hand feel and touch response. It's all 5 out of 5! The price is the cherry on the cake. I don't know why people are still buying Note 10s and Pixels. This phone has everything at half the price. I have a pixel too and honestly I liked the software of the Oneplus better! It's that clean. 128 gb is more than enough for most people.For 33K this phone is a steal. If this is your first time with OnePlus and doubting the brand. Just don't. The phone comes with 2 year warranty and free pick up and drop for any service issues. That's the kind of focus the brand is putting in here. So don't worry about the reliability."
5,"Amazing power packed mobile phone with well thought upon software and hardware features, OnePlus provides most of the features which I have always wanted in my mobile most of which are not known to many so I tried covering them in best possible ways.PROS-------1) Oneplus mobiles are always optimized with best available hardware at the time of launch leaving no room for any competition and demand, moreover the Oxygen OS software is updated regularly fixing any issues and suggestions provided by the user community.2) Contains almost all the needed software without any unnecessary bloatware like MI, Samsung and other mobile providers thus preventing any need for installing or purchasing from the google store i) Contains inbuilt call recorder integrated inside the phone dialer ii) Contains inbuilt screen recorder which records best quality videos iii) Inbuit features like Night Mode, Reading Mode, Zen Mode, Focus Mode to suit the different usage of mobile during a specific scenario iv) An exclusive features when the mobile flash is used as a torch the brightness is reduced and when using it for photos or videos the full flash brightness is used, this was something I wanted in phone as it serves the intended purpose of flash light without putting stress on eyes and battery v) Built in caller identification which does not work as well as Truecaller so can be ignored or disabled3) Pre-configured themes to suit different people and since having an AMOLED display the dark theme just provides the best experience to users.4) Excellent memory management for all apps which is optimized for most used apps to provided the best experience to users without unnecessarily killing the apps5) Built in steps counter and digital wellbeing feature which tracks overall phone usage and provides a holistic report to user regarding how much time is spent on different applications6) Comes with 90 Hz display which I feel is over marketed, I haven't seen much differences on using the 90 Hz over 60 Ghz just that the battery drains faster.All the above provides the OnePlus launcher an edge over the default Android experience, the Oxygen OS is lightweight and feature packed and actively improved by the company, there are certain issues which the companies might fix in the future updates.CONS-------1) The Oxygen OS is buggy and sometimes the mobile screen just blanks out leaving the user with no other option to go for a force reboot, I have faced it couple of time where the screen goes unresponsive but mobile calls can be heard.2) The camera application should be further optimized as the mobile contains best available camera hardware but fails to capture good photos in various overly bright and dark environments.3) Mobile screen is too large to use with one hand and there is no feature to reduce the screen size which even basic mobiles from Moto and other manufactures provides4) The WiFi calling is good but several times the voice just stops in after few seconds but the dialer app still shows the called as connected, this is happening just for the WiFi calling option but not on the network calling5) Battery works great and provides backup for around two days but sometimes it drains faster than expected still providing one day backup, this could be optimized in future updates."
5,"The media could not be loaded.      The model I have with me is the OnePlus 7T 8gb ram 256gb storage option, which at Rs 39,999 (now 34,999) looked like a great option. This is the little brother of the OnePLus 7T pro, but comparing them both the extras wouldn't interest my wife much.We have a 30 watt WARP charger included, aptly named 30T which is a variant of the charger that shipped with the oneplus 7, very nice. Oneplus phones support warp charging which can charge up your phone to 70% in 30 minutes. So if you are in a rush, 30 minutes is enough to at least give you respectable phone time. But you do need to use the included charger and cable.A transparent case is also included, I'm liking that more and more manufacturers are including at least a silicone case with their phones. There are no ear buds of any sort, as the oneplus 7T has no headphone jack and keeping costs down being their mantra, none are included.The screen is only 1080p , but 1080x2400 due to its 20:9 aspect ratio. OnePLus calls their display the 'Fluid AMOLED display'. With a 90hz screen refresh rate, scrolling is soo much smoother, which only when you see it in action would you feel the fluidness of the animations. I couldn't see too much of a smoothness, but if you can't, just change to 60hz in the options which would save on battery. Color’s are generally muted or natural, but you can change between the modes if you want them to pop. Also on the phone is a factory applied screen protector. Its ok, I do see coloration when you view the phone from an angle, but straight on, there’s no problem.Phone unlock modes are the standard pin, pattern and face unlock etc. We also have fingerprint unlock using an in-display fingerprint sensor. Setting up is also easy, as with most fingerprint sensors, just follow the instructions and tap on the location marked to register your fingerprint. Once done, whenever we pick up the phone it displays the fingerprint sensor icon, tap it to unlock. The sensor is quite fast, unlocking almost instantaneously. This is an optical sensor, so you can see it lighting up my finger as it scans it. Newer phones use ultrasonic fingerprint sensors, which are more accurate. But this works quite well.The camera, the camera on the one plus 7 has been upgraded quite a bit, giving phones that cost twice as much a run for their money. There are three on the back, a 17mm ultrawide camera, a 26 millimeter wide camera as well as a 51mm telephoto camera. A 16 mp selfie camera can be found in the front, here are some sample shots. Colors are OK at this price point, but still needs some work to challenge the real flagships.The OnePlus 7T has a 3,800 mAh battery, the battery life is respectable, but in order to squeeze a little more out of it you can switch to 60hz refresh rate for the display. But with the warp charger at hand, 30 minutes and you have the battery at 70%.Speakers are loud in this phone, the sounds are clear and I found it to be louder than my galaxy s9 plus. The front facing speaker does most of the job, firing the sound you.At a price point half of most flagships this phone has a great screen, great performance, and cameras are really quite good. The OS experience is fast and smooth, and the inclusion of three cameras with features like macro and steady shot are a nice touch. The speakers are also loud, and a hdr 10 compliant display would make content consumption more gratifying. Getting such a well rounded phone for the price is amazing, hats off to oneplus for pulling this off."
5,"Pros+Never before Seen Buttery smooth - Amazing display.Good Camera setup with triple cameras that are actually useful.Great battery life. 6 to 7 hours of screen time.Decently Fast warp ChargingGreat Speakers. Good loudness and also a little bit of bass. Great detail.Build Quality. Amazing. If i could only wish to run it without a case. Feels amazing in the hand.Cons-Charging could have been faster (but it is faster than majority of the phones) considering this takes around 50mins whilst the Realme does it in 30mins and it costs cheaper.Camera bump maybe prone to scratches. Noticed a tiny scratch on the circular lens.No heaphone jack. Cant plug in headphones. And any bluetooth headphones are still ways to catch up to the wired headphones. I miss the headphone jack.A big phone. Difficult, but not impossible to maneuver in one hand.Detailed consensus: ~The Display is amazing. Seriously. 90hz. I wasnt as impressed at the beginning as i expected to be. But in month's period ..just looking at my mom's OnePlus 7 screen feels sluggish. Any other conventional display seems outdated and that's where i realised the brilliance of this tech. It just works to provide the best experience without you even noticing. I became really fast at responding with the touch. Gaming didn't work upto 90hz atleast to my experience with pubg but it is great as it is at 60fps. Camera is also good. Wide angle shots are the best when u need to get one giant family in a picture. Portrait shots look like professional dslr shots to post on the social media. Nightscape works decent for this segment. There are some caveats being the white balance, which seemes to be inconsistent among the three cameras under harsh lighting conditions (probably can be imporved in software updates). Battery life is excellent IMHO. 6 to 7 hours easily with moderate usage. Even if u game hours on the end, you should atleast get around atleast 5 and half hours of screen time. There are, however, very small but few bugs. The quick launch from fingerprint keeps deselecting the contacts i selected. The gallery seems to have some problem sometimes sending media through whatsapp. There are a few bugs but to my all honesty Apple's IOS right now has a lot more than that. And when it comes to the software, this OS is the best fork of android and spending a couple of grand more is justifiably worth it. Once you use it, the ingenuity cannot go unnoticed and makes everything simpler. Overall great phone and if you are planning to use it for a long time then you shouldn't have to think twice."
5,"I am using this product from last 5 months now. A good upgrade from my previous one, 3T. I will list down the pros and cons for your better understanding.Pros-1. CHARGING- the fast 30W charger is absolutely amazing. Charges the phone from 0 to 100 just inside an hour. 30 mins charge enough to give power for d entire day.2. PERFORMANCE- 8GB RAM + 855+ Snapdragon is a lethal combination ?? fluid & perfect in every sense. Never faced any lagginess in day to day use.3. DISPLAY- the fluid AMOLED 90Hz display is outstanding. Gives hard times going back to 60Hz displays.4. STERIO SPEAKER- the dual Dolby Atmos speakers are louder, clearer & better than ever. The music comes out equivalent to that of mid ranged bluetooth speakers. The bass is also fantastic.5. CAMERA- the triple camera set up for 48+12+16mp does the job amazing. The best part is macro shots.6. OS- OnePlus's biggest strength is its Oxygen OS. Better than stock android in all sense.Cons-1. NO 3.5mm Headphone Jack2. 3800mAh battery is just average. Will give you backup whole day if you use moderately.3. The phone is fragile because of its glass back and needs to be kept in a protective case 24*74. My phone had an issue initially while rebooting which was however gone after an update.My final conclusion- GO FOR IT!! IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY.

5,"Note before reading further: Do not deter yourself from buying it because it is a 5-month old smartphone, seriously, I know I'm not regretting the decision at all.Been using it for just about two days now so this won't be a detailed review.. just want to let potential buyers know about the pros and cons observed by a person with a relatively average usecase. (Until I root, after warranty period is over).Pros:1. Possibly the best in class display experience. (This is my first amoled screen and I'm not going back).2. Great haptics.3. Great audio output.4. Near stock Android experience. (My first experience with anything other than stock Android, and I'm really impressed with how small the learning curve is.)5. If you're going for 8/256 config, lagfree experience is always guaranteed along with plenty of superfast storage.6. Fast charging speeds (Not the fastest in the market but not bad either, goes 25 to 100 in roughly under an hour).7. Smooth out of the box usage experience with almost all essentials working the way they should. (Google account backup is broken which is the only major bug I've found, but then again it's been like this for months for a wide range of devices and Google doesn't seem to care)Not really cons but just minor things that might inconvenience you:1. (Subjectively) Average battery life (Getting around 8 to 8.5 hours of SOT with no gaming, heavy surfing, moderate streaming and other media consumption at 60Hz).2. (Subjectively) Average camera experience (Not into cliking photos but can conclude that camera level is not on par with other flagships from major non-chinese manufacturers)3. Not really a con but a vertically oriented charging brick would've been nice as the stock charger does fit loosely on a regular sized power socket.4. To get above mentioned SOTs, you will have to enable advanced/aggressive optimization under battery settings which will affect notification influx when phone goes into idle/ is dozing.5. Depending of the device you transition from, you may find yourself accidentally touching the rear camera array more often than you'd like which will take some getting used to.Overall: A really solid affordable flagship that does almost all the things right and is a solid daily driver for most users and a great entry point if this is going to be your first flagship just like it is for me.

5,"Little retrospect. I was using Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 for the past two years. Now coming to this phone.Pros:Very organized software: Everything is intuitive. I was used to samsung experience so this software feels a hell less cluttered. Even comparing to one ui, I feel oxygen os is better.Camera: Simply the best camera u can get at this price point! Night mode, ultrawide, stabilization is all very good.Performance: Snapdragon 855+ and oxygen os. Nothing to say anymore.Battery: Excellent battery optimization. Even though I have pinned some apps in the ram and am a heavy user, 5+ hours of screen on time is consistent.Speaker and call reception: all very excellent.Face unlock: works 100% of the time and is really very fast.Cons:Missing Always on Display: ambient display in one plus serves no purpose at all.Buggy Software: it will seem odd to you but after using this phone for about 2 months i am confused why other people wont mention it. There are some minor glitches that keep appearing in this phone. Sometimes the status bar will just disappear until it's restarted. Gaming mode causes problems with some games, like the moving parts in the game will disappear and won't correct unless the game is restarted. Screen freezes are very common. And some more little things that become irritating over time.Fingerprint scanner: works maybe 60% of the time.If anything is not mentioned, it's because everything else is just fine."
5,"Hello dear buyers,I am writing this review after using this product for 6 months.Let's come directly to the point:1. Super fast phone.2. Fingerprint reader and face detection is so fast some time I thought whether I have set any screen lock option or not.3. Camera is too good. Night mode is too good. Some images also attached.4. Video quality is superb.5. Surround sound is too good.6. Phones speaker are really awesome.7. Best part is, after playing game like pubg continuously for 1.5 hour, handset is not getting warm that much that is the thing which I love the most.8. Charging, oh my God, it's too fast.9. Battery back, for a moderate user it will last just above 24 hours and for a heavy user you may need to charge the device twice in 24 hours of time span.10. If you are a moderate user and looking to buy a device which you want to use at least 3 to 4 years then you can go for this product blindly.11. Only one problem so far which I realized that is, it is not possible to buy a costly phone like this every time for a middle class person. As it was my dream to own a OnePlus so I did it. Actually the thing is, this phone is so fast that you are not going to even like any other phones in mid range segment. After using this product I realized that my budget has increased alot for the coming future days. ??

5,"My first OnePlus and I am loving it.It's been 4 days I have been using the phone and below are my pros and cons.Pros...1) very good display. For display 5/52) Snapdragon 855+ is very fluid and with Android 10 it works very efficiently. So performance 5/5.3) I know many are complaining about battery life not good however as per my observation if you keep the display at 90 hz refresh rate the battery is bound to be draining fast. If you are travelling and won't get any power socket for many hours I would suggest to keep the refresh rate at 60 hz it will really improve battery performance.4) Charging 5/5. With warp charge 30t the charging is absolutely brilliant.5) Camera 5/5. I have read reviews where people are complaining about camera quality being blur however I have not faced any such issues. It's true that it takes a little bit of time to adjust the focus however the camera samples are pretty good. I even use a DSLR so know a little bit about adjusting the focus. My tip use grid lines for better focussing.6) Looks 5/5. Looks are really premium. However I would suggest anyone buying this phone to compulsory have a good rugged case because it is important to protect this from scratches. It's true a rugged case will make the phone look bulgy but I am ok with that.Cons1) No 3.5 mm jack and OnePlus does not provides an adapter as well in the box. According to me it's an essential item as with the low availability of type c headphones I think a 3.5 mm adapter in the box would have been very helpful.2) video output on phone looks brilliant however when taken to laptop it looks way too much over saturated. My suggestion to OnePlus is to fix this issue with an update because the video performance comes nowhere to the still pictures performance. If the issue is not fixed than it would really dwarf the phones still pics capability and would lead to a bad review.My suggestion if anyone looking to buy OnePlus go for the 7t without any doubt if you like the looks because looks are subjective to one's personal liking. As for me I love the looks.

5,"I bought the device few days back and what I feel is it's absolutely worth the money. The build quality, the heptic, the software are all it's best part. The stock camera is not that good but as you know good photos can be the outcome of some trash camera also if you are good enough to take decent pictures. ( You can seamlessly install gcam and use it)The battery life is where I think OnePlus little bit stumbled upon. In daily usage ( no heavy gaming ) I get around 6 hours of sot which is pretty good actually with this 3800 mah battery. But sometimes it feels that the battery is draining too fast but again that can be fixed via software updates. The 30 watt fast charging is just a relaxation ! You don't have to worry about your battery getting charged in time if you forgot to switch on inspite of plugging in ! No heating during charging ( The power break becomes hot although). ( Don't use your smartphone for heavy tasking during charging, then it might get hot )The fingerprint scanner is also good not the best but good. Sometimes it denies to accept my thumb ! The phone never overheats imo. ( Although if you keep your brightness max with 90hz in bright sun and play with camera or do some heavy task then it might get hot enough to worry )The software is one of the main plus point of OnePlus. It comes with android 10 out of the box so it will definitely get 2 major android upgrades and 3 years of bimonthly security patch updates.Overall coming from my 3 and half years old redmi note 4 to this OnePlus is making me enjoy my phone once again. The device is definitely worth for you if you want flagship grade performance with least amount spending."
5,"Bought this beast 4 days back that is on 30th of May 2020. Yes, this beast gives complex to many 2020 new flagships.Pros:1. Excellent build quality which feels premium to hold and looks classy2. Display quality is top notch in this segment3. Blazing fast processor. There is no lag whatsoever.4. OXygen OS is selling point for One plus devices and rightly so. Such smooth and lovely gestures and clean UI.5. GCam works fine. Stock camera is goo too. I can say that it's not great but good enough to do your job.6. 30watt charger is ice on cake. It makes your task super easy.7. Face unlock in this device has become super fast with new updates. Works amazingly. No complaints. Even in zero light, it works perfectly.Cons:1. Battery life is not that great. Mild uses can last you full day.2. Camera could be improved with software updates. 48 megapixel camera doesn't shoot automatically but you need to go to Pro mode for that.3. Some issues with YouTube videos. Sometimes, it doesn't pinch to zoom. But I am sure it would be corrected with some updates.I couldn't find much cons for now. I am still searching for it.My verdict: Instead of going for one plus 8 which is 8K costlier, go for this device. It gives you extra 2GB of RAM. Camera is same in both the devices.For those who are thinking to go with other brands in this range, just don't. Once try out Oxygen OS and you would fall in love.I shifted from Nokia 6.1 plus and this device is like rocket fast for me.I am loving it."
5,"The phone is just perfect. Flagship grade. Minus the headphone jack, IP rating and a bit heavy, else everything thing is great and it turns out be a great package. Software is bloat free. UI (oxygenOS) is quiet stock like but with its own set of customisation. The colour, Glacier Blue looks stunning in the matt finish with its own incorporation of gradient colour shift. Has a big camera bump but is livable with coz it comes with a case that's grips it's firmly. Though the colours are a bit saturated at times but the over all image quality is beautiful, well detailed and pleasing. Night mode is another area where it does quit well but not as perfect as other flagships. The fingerprint reader is optical type and is the fastest of its type when compared to other optical ones out there. Face unlock is 2D based but really fast and unlocks in a blink. The battery a big 3800 mah is just great to get you through a day with mild usage but does take a hit while heavy usage such as gaming, but non the less it ships with 30 watt Warp Charger that charges it in 50 mins to almost full. Need to mention that it doesn't ship with a headphone nor with a type C to 3.5 mm jack converter which I feel should have been a standard given the premium price one is paying for it.

5,"Despite of OP 8 series, at 35k OP 7T is still the phone to buy if you have the budget.Pros:1.Display topped with 90Hz refresh rate makes the phone gorgeous & buttery smooth.2.Oxygen Os is simply the best possible android skin out there & is also customizable.3.Camera: I don't know about critics. But this triple lens camera is something. Super Macro mode & Nightscape mode is on another level. Thanks to the 2X telephoto lens. The contrast level is slightly high but I like them nevertheless.4.30T warp charge. The relatively low capacity 3800mah battery can charge up insanely fast. Use a 30 min charge anytime during your schedule & u get a 61% boost up.5.Host of other features like haptic feedback, slider button etc.Cons:1.Durability : be cautious & buy a good protective back cover.2.Battery : Although it gives a 7 hour screen on time which is relatively good & can last a day, for gamers & binge watchers carry a powerbank as backup. This is not a con.Verdict: Hands down this is the best oneplus phone till date.If you need a phone that can lasts longer, perform daily jobs smoothly, takes good pictures this phone is good enuf.Thank you.

5,"This is my first purchase from a costly phone range after using 10k budget phones.After a several months of use i found no issue until a month My phone wasn hang on bootlogo suddenly after usual battery drainage, gone to service center found no help rather than factory data reset and erase everything they say but I disagree to give my phone to them that day, as I had some imp data in there, so I took my phone back home and after charging it to full then I don't know how it came back to life again, then after that this problem was never happened again.About this phone I think this phone is way costly as its camera it not that top notch quality, Click good pictures under good source of light, but night vision is good like okish, portrait is also good but only from back cam setup(48 mp),Battery life is good when you use you don't use your phone that much, otherwise ok until you gaming, or using highly loading websites, specially when you play PUBG, the battery drains down quickly here. So this is a major drawback.When it comes about processing speed and visuals (90hz) it gives all its best.So if you want to buy it for faster multitasking or gaming its a good choice, but if you want to buy this phone for battery backup, camera quality, you can find something better than this"
5,"I know there are many geeks out there and writing so many technical reviews. Writing this after using for 9monthsFor me this is my 2nd Oneplus device. The first one is 5T. I've used it for 3yrs and went for a upgrade. So I'm used to the UI and Oxygen OS. As far as the other brands and phones concerned this beats out on theQuality of MakeStability of OSPowerful DeviceYou can fit tempered glass with UAG or Rinke Cases. But there is a jugad that a tempered glass vendor near by home did. He cut minute piece in edge and tempered glass is working fineDASH Charge didn't work for few days and there was a issue with uodate. Didn't expect this situation will araise.. This has been fixed in an update.Use Ringke case for perfect grip and protectionUse UAG for a armour protection.I had to cut the Ringke and UAG edges a bit for the glass to fit.I got it at 27,500/- (Exchanging my OnePlus 5T)Have dropped the phone back cover got replaced for 3500/- seems to be pricey but I don't have insurance."
5,"I bought the phone back in Dec 2019 ...I still love the phone ...the charting blazing fast ...never have I ever plugged it in for an hour ...Pics are good ...they have a bit higher contrast and saturation ...no need to edit before posting anywhere ...Macro is just a gimmick...most people don't use it after day 1Speakers are great ...display is awesome ...90hz don't matter much if you already own a smooth device - appleWhat is miss from my redmi note 5 pro is great battery life , headphone jackSome people consider the camera shape an eyesore ...for me it's beauty and uniqueIt makes this phone stand out from every OnePlus out thereI have even owned htc one m8 and that was a tank and was very heavyThis is not that much heavy ...but some will consider it heavy ...like some reviews have it mentioned in themThe only con I find is the tear drop notch has trickled down to cheaper phonesAnd from front you can't really differentiate a cheaper phone from this ( redmi note 8 pro )I was going to buy iphone xr ( which was cheaper back then ) but I bought thisIf you love pure androidDon't like miui and realme os then go for this deviceOr else realme x2 pro is better value for moneyOr wait for the poco F2 pro which will beat the sh*t out of both these devices in performance as well as value for money"
5,"I'm using it for 25 days.I will talk about its pros and cons.Cons:1. Less battery life than other ships out there...2. Has problem with low light photography.3. Get heats a bit sometimes...but not all the time.4. In hand feel is good but, feels a little havier.Pros:1. The best processor in 35k. ??2. The best camera??3. In low light it takes the best photo using the flash ??4. The Macro lens is a killer !!! The best ever ??5. Battery performance is decent. If you play games all the time it will still give you a life of 4-5 hours. But in decent daily life use you will deffinately get a battery life of 10-12 hours ??6. 90 Hz display with 855+ processor is a deadly combination for the smoothest feel while using.7. 30W Warp charger is a beast !!! Charges 50% in just 15-18 minutes!!! ??So above all the numbers I would like to say that in this prize range Oneplus 7T is the best phone.You might think that 3800 battery won't last long, but I gurantee that with normal daily use you will able to get an all day battery life for sure.Go for it, choose this flagship among all the ships out there a d tou'll realise that its better than a lot of them.I've shared some of my captures in normal and macro lenses check them out.

5,"Overall rating from my perspective is about 5 start after using this beast for whole one day.Below observations been observed as:1. Overall device come with mind boggling screen refresh rate of 90Hz, and performance.2. Battery can drain quickly if phone is being used with 90Hz refresh rate, but can manage with battery optimization. But this problem effectively handled with WARP Charge 30 charger (believe me its FAST.)3. Oxygen OS is love. Come with no bloatware. Feels like stock android. Very FAST due to its best OS optimizations.4. Nice animations and customization to use.5. Display is also of good quality and has few options to set ambient display colors.6. Speakers are of really flagship quality and its very loud and clear. No need to use headphones while watching movie or playing game. I think its because of there no HEADPHONE JACK and OnePlus has logically implemented this kind of speakers to compensate HEADPHONE JACK omission.7. Comes with SD-855+ processor. Obviously no need to discuss this point.8. Good camera (Could have been best, but a big OKAY for me. But that camera bump, I didn't like it at all).9. No issue with Bluetooth connectivity and Wi-Fi.10. Large and clear sound while calling. No call drops.11. Red Cable and OnePlus community is something to know whats going on with OnePlus (Specially I like these communities).12. I love unboxing feeling of OnePlus 7T. Loves those stickers and invitation card from Pete (CEO of OnePlus).13. Its TPU phone case is also of good quality and can be used for few months. It covers edges very well and camera bump as well. (If you can spent RS.1300 buck to get carbon case, go for it.)14. Fingerprint scanner is insane fast and those animations comes in customization are quirky and looks something new.15. Face unlock is also insane quick. I tried it in light and low light, it works so fast.

5,"Nothing much about the device, its good! Will go fine with the further updates!Dear seller!If you wish to send a device that is slightly used & refurbished, atleast ensure that its cleaned not just externally but internally as well!When I switched on the device got a ROM failure message, if any user whose not see this error as soon as they start their new phone, they are bound to get scared, or per my neighbour die lol of loosing 34k.Well after hard booting understood that this phone that was delivered today was definitely used, had some nice pictures & data of the previous owner. With all due respect, informed the super enthusiastic Amazon customer care, with the silliest response as usual, formatted the brand newly delivered phone, wiping all the data off from the previous user!Finally, my newly delivered slightly used brand new oneplus 7t started!Amazon, pls cmon dont stoop down your standard to what ebay India is! Any regular user firstly who doesn't know much abt software, would have had pained themselves seeing the dead ROM message! I'm not going to return the phone but respectfully use it, but if your sellers are sending slight used phones as new ones! A heads up, alert would be great or just don't do such!"
5,"Starting with the delivery : I received this unit during lockdown before the allocated time. So Thank you Amazon for delivering it before hand! The Box wasn't tampered or torn.... it was intact!Demand : Even after 8 to 9 months after it's launch... this device is still popular amongst us.. even if we compare it to one plus 8. And the Price drop has made it more affordable.Looks and Feel :This device is a style statement in itself. I loved its look at the first instant itself. I'll give 9 out of 10 for its looks. The way it's smooth edges are, the notification key, power button and volume rocker, all stand in their respective place. It feels very light in handHowever the oreo camera might be a matter of discontentment from person to person... but i love it.Smoothness and Performance:Device is very smooth.. thanks to qualcomm motherboard unit. Graphic intensive games and apps run smoothly in it. Just a slight heating when playing in high graphic settings.Screen : Amoled looks elegant with 90 hz refresh rate. It is smooth and having great ppi. and luminous intensity.UI : UI is good and simple and easy to operate. However found the UI navigation hanging at times when we navigate using the full screen setting mode.Earphones : I purchased One plus wireless Z along with this unit and after the oxygen os update... it works great with dolby atmos settings. However i do miss 3.5 mm jack... what's the problem in providing that (wired earphones still exist)Battery : Battery is a pain point .. .. have to charge it every now and then. 3800 mah is very less .. it gives a lot of hiccups and we have to carry the charger where ever we go.

5,"I am glad that I bought this OnePlus 7T and it is just amazing!! I assure you , it's the best choice for this price range.What I like is it has nearly all the features that OnePlus 7 Pro gives ( and more including outstandingly better macro camera and Snapdragon 855+) and that too, at much less price. The camera quality is very nice as you can see. Yes it struggles in low light but still, it's much better. However battery is 3800 mAh, still it gives a very decent battery backup at 90Hz because of its optimised oxygen os and fluid amoled display.If you are a gamer, you are going to have a very amazing experience. The graphics are a feast to the eye. It's so fast , I just love it.The Os is highly customisable and you can design it however you want. The Zen mode provides you a break and lets you enjoy life. Reading Mode is fantastic. The look is very premium.Overall, if your budget is under 40k , this is the best choice. Period.

5,"""A thing of beauty is a joy forever'""Jack of all trades, master of all'""Bold and beautiful""""Pure temptation""This phone is so beautiful, elegant and buttery smooth that you will feel addicted to this masterpiece and it will be a cynosure for all eyes. OnePlus has truly shown it's microengineering skills while manufacturing this OnePlus 7t.I did a lot of research for 2 months before buying a new phone. This is true VFM phone.Pros.1. Processor.Snapdragon 855+ is flawless and needs no further description. All high graphic games run ultrasmoothly. Phone automatically shifts to game mode while playing games.2. Display.6.55 inch HDR 10+ fluid amoled 90 Hz display is always vibrant and soothing to view. It has colour enhancement feature for videos and it is amazing.As per me its 6.55 inch size is perfect to hold.Avoid phones of display of 6.7 as they are bulky and difficult to hold. You will never use IPS display again once you will hold this phone.3. Body design/built quality - Ergonomic designed aluminium alloy body with Corning Gorilla glass 5 on both sides. Premium feel in hands. Also it comes with free good quality transparent protector case4. Camera- It is simply amazing. Pics capture the each and every detail of objects. Macroshots are fabulous. (See images). Enjoy capturing the beauty of nature.Slow motion video recording is excellent in natural lighting. Inside the rooms you will notice darkness and screen flickering.5 . Speaker- Dolby Atmos certified speakers both at above and below are loud and gives a mesmerizing experience while watching multimedias.6. Touch response/fingerprint scanner/faceunlock-Phone gets unlocked in a fraction of second. Touch is buttery smooth.7. Haptic feedback- So soothing experience just like an iPhone.8. Battery- Battery is good but not excellent. However 30W wrap charger is so fast that it charges my phone from 0 to 50% in 20 minutes. So battery is not a major issue and I can easily get 12 hours of usage time.Also battery optimization is amazing.I was worried about its battery life before buying it as most of the persons have given bad reviews regarding its battery. But believe me wrap charger makes things simpler.9. Internet, call quality and Wifi- Excellent10.Oxygen OS- Best ever. I was using a mi phone before and miui OS was just very bad. Believe me oxygen OS is without any annoying ads and is so easy to use.11. Extra featuresGray scale- this feature turns phone display to black and white and it looks amazing as well.Side slider switch- It is an added feature like in iphonesCons- Not seen yetFinal verdict- I am not a technical person. I have never bought a phone of more than 18000 in my life. But honestly saying spending 38000 on a 256 gb device like this is worth. It is an Android iPhone...:-)Blindly go for it. I myself had wasted a lot of months on deciding which phone to buy.

5,"A nice product to invest your money. Everything awesome. Mainly I bought it for Snapdragon 855+ processor. There is no lag when I play in PUBG and 90 HZ display is one of the key features for gamers. Fnatic mode is a very good feature for gamers. The camera quality is wonderful. I was redmi user. When I switched tp One plus,I can feel the difference. The battery is the main issue. 3800 mah is not enough. But we have the 30W warp charger support to fulfill that problem. I really amazed at how this mobile charges my phone from 0 to 100% within 1 hour. Why oneplus does not provide connector in the box.There is no 3.5mm jack in this mobile. SO we need type C to 3.5mm jack adapter for use your wired headphones. Audio quality wise, it is really nice one. Dual speakers with stunning sound quality. Currenlty I am playing PUBG without headphones only. You can feel the sound difference. Sound is the important factor in PUBG. Better puchase adapter from Oneplus store Lockdown time, we can't get it. Limited places only, they selling their products. Dsiplay quality is amazing. 6.55 inch Fluid AMOLED display. Mainly I bought this phone for processor and display only. Amazing quality. For PUBG players, gyroscope works better, There is latency time ! That's all."
5,"OnePlus 7T is a very good phone available at a very decent price. I paid ?38k for the phone. I have been using this phone for about two weeks now.The delivery experience was great. My delivery was upgraded to express delivery for free and the product arrived within three days of placing the order.Moving on to the actual product. I think this phone might be the best phone at this price.The camera quality is great in natural as well as artificial light. Low light photos could be better. I love the super macro mode to take photos from super close to the subject.The battery life is great, but not excellent. But the super fast Warp charging more than makes up for it.The In-display Fingerprint reader is also super fast, but tends to miss 1/10 times.The 90hz screen my favorite feature of this phone, and the oxygen os is greatly optimized to make full use of the high refresh rate to give you a very smooth experience.OnePlus also gives out very quick updates for the os, which is another plus point for this phone.The transparent case provided in the box is also very good. It provides a good grip on the phone while also not hiding the beautiful back of the phone.One regret is that they don't provide a audio jack to usb-c converter in the box, which most others do.Overall the OnePlus 7T provides most of the features of a flagship at a pretty decent price.

5,"---Usually I buy only the Samsung and apple phones because of the brand value and the apple's environment respectively. But this time i thought i should try out the flagship killer brand and boy i m glad i did. The oxygen OS makes the smooth experience even smoother. The camera is even better as compared to other phones in the same price category.---The SD855+ is one of the performance beast out there....don't even have second thoughts about it....---the battery performance is good if you are light to medium user. It should easily last you a day. But if you are a heavy user and like to play games and stuff often throughout the day, then the battery may fall short and you might have to plug it in the evening. But yeah, after half an hour, you are good to go.---The haptic feedback while playing games and the display are the best. The 90Hz fluid amoled display makes the whole experience pretty smooth.....---Overall a great buy. If u have a budget of 35k, then go for it....great value for money"
5,"The phone is fab . This is by far the vest chinese phone . 855+ works flawlessly . Camera is stupendous and the video recording is great too . The build quality is solid but it definitely needs a case as the back glass is fragile.The display is just way too good for this phone . 1000 nits of brightness is just too much .The battery lasts almost for a day with moderate usage but if gaming is done , the phones needs to get charged 2 times the day . This is not a huge problem as the 30 watt is insanely fast af .Stereo speakers are very loud too and the oxygen OS is the best os of android.Gaming is just too smooth but if played for more than 2 hours at a stretch , it heats a little bit (around 41°c-42°c ) .I really miss the headphone jack in this device . Alteast they could have provided a adapter but unfortunately it isn't there .Overall its an extremely valuable for money device . Comparing it to iqoo and realme , its wayy better than x2 pro except fot the charging but for iqoo , i personally dont like the os. Also it's a new brand and we don't know how reliable it is. How would be the updates etc . Also iqoo comes with the same os offered in vivo smartphone which is absolutely shit.Samsung s10 lite (128+8) variant is out of stock and (512+8) is for 50k which i feel is just wayy to overpriced .Conclusion:-If os is not a deal breaker then iqoo is better then one plus 7t .Don't but realme x2 pro . Camera is pathetic . Also the os isn't that great .

5,"Starting with the built quality, it's just beyond my expectations.....just so sturdy an premium......when you hold the phone you could say that's it's one of the best feeling phone in hand.Secondly I would say the cameras are pretty good but the optimization of the processing of the pictures could a bit more good but you could use the Google camera to correct it.Third the whole experience of using the phone in a day to day basis is amazing as oxygen os makes it feel flawless. also the 90hz display is way way smoother than the 60hz which brings to my next point, the battery lifeFourth the battery life is not so good if you are using the 90hz refresh rate but you could easily go to settings and set it to 60hz refresh rate which will help you to drain your battery slower.but due to the charging speed the battery life is isn't a deal breaker for me. Means the 30t charger is so fast that it could charge your phone from 5%-100% in less than an hour which is very convenient for my usage.Fifth the biometrics on this phone is really quick which you will absolutely love. The face I'd is spontaneous, you don't even feel that the phone is scanning your face its feels like unlocking the phone just by pressing the power button. And the talking about the fingerprint it's just enough fast which someone could need.So my final verdict is if you want a budget friendly flagship level phone OnePlus 7t could be your only choice as it feels premium , pubg runs smooth as subway surfer, camera is great, charging technology is just out of the world also has the back support of trusted brand OnePlus if any thing goes wrong.

5,"The phone is very snappy. Performance during day to day tasks is super quick and if you come from a mid-range device, you will feel the difference. You can do heavy gaming without any hiccups. I play PUBG a lot and this OP7T plays it without breaking any sweat, btw it supports HDR+Extreme graphics settings (in case any of you is wondering).Besides there is this really high quality vibration motor that gives you a very premium feeling, I mean at first you will think what difference does it make, but trust me once you start using it, it just adds to the overall experience.Camera is really good too, I feel like that I won't need to use GCam on this.Battery is a bit smaller than the norm these days but I am easily getting 5 hours 30 minutes of Screen on time (netflix, YouTube and pubg mainly) which is really good.The overall in hand feel is like a candy, it's quite slim and feels premium but have to be careful and put a case at the back, otherwise the glass at the back may shatter if it falls."
5,"Using this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto. If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint. It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown. Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store."
5,"This is my first oneplus phone. Here are my thoughts about this phone after using it for 20 days.Battery: Oneplus 7T is too good in evey department except for battery life. It will easily get through a day but sometimes you will need to charge twice a day. 30T warp charger charges the phone from 15-100% in just 55 minutes.Camera:Triple camera setup is one of the strong points of Oneplus 7T especially 48mp main camera with OIS takes some stunning images.Display: 90hz super amoled is silky smooth.As it is an amoled colors are rich and vibrant but you need to tweak the colors in display settings. I prefer advanced+amoled wide gamut+cold this combination brings out the best.Speakers: dual speakers are underrated in this phone. They are very loud and crisp. It gives immersive experience while consuming media content.User interface: Oxygen os, the name is enough. it just flies ??.Overall i will rate this phone as high as 9/10. if you are thinking about to buy then just buy it no second thoughts??

5,"After a month of usage I really feel OP7T is a great phone. I really like the camera (I come from LG g6). Battery performance is average but it comes with quick charge so a 15 mins charge would push the device to few more hours for regular usage.As far as the gaming concern I played PUBG and COD without any hicups. PUBG even supports 90fps at Max setting. So you know this is a killer.The high refresh panel is definitely worth it and you can clearly see the difference if you come from a lower refresh rate screen.Camera performance is really good. Not the best but better than average. Super macro mode is one thing you need to try if you really like to take quick macros on your mobile.Build quality is really good...yeah I do miss the headphone jack sometimes.. fingerprint is fast and reliable if you don't have sweaty or wet hands.I really recommend to pick this one if you are looking for something in this price point. A device which is not flashy as rogphone and kicks some performance ..

5,"Its a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you're having budget of 42k and you're going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you're getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you're getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you're getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn't buy 64 GB Varient because if you're a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- ""if you don't like cameras then we've really messed up"". i think - ""if you like cameras then they've really messed up"". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they're saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you're paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)"
5,"Well, I am reviewing this again after using it for 2 months. Found the OS and interface very poor. Doesn't connect to a few models of bluetooth headsets (specially Boat). Sometimes call will come but won't appear on screen. Battery back is very poor, will discharge to zero in 6 to 7 hrs even if kept idle. Display is good, camera better than most redmi phones, not exceptional. With all the power on paper, I found it lagging a few times. Some applications behave very weirdly time to time. Fingerprint unlock is painful, needs 2 to 3 attempts. OnePlus is nothing close to a premium brand it claims to be and far far away from iphones. I found my old redmi note5 pro performing very well with that price tag. This phone doesn't deserve the hype, go for i phones if you want to feel premium. Else Redmi phones will outperform this very easily with a very low price. I realised it was a bad decision after a week's use, but sadly Amazon won't let it return easily, lot of questions, uploads, tech verification etc. I wish I had bought it from Flipkart, they are very good at returns. Never going to buy another phone from Amazon."
5,"Iam writing this rewiew after 1 month of usage. Iam really impressed with the mobile.No Problems at all.Pros are1)Display(90HZ,1000 nits Brightness,Hdr10+) 2)Cameras ?? (Both Front & Back)3)Warp Charge 30T(Charges from 0 to 100 in 50 min) 4)Weight Balance (It is 190g but feels like 170g something) 5)Last but not least Oxygen os and Snapdragon 855plus Chipset6)Signal Reception and Call Quality7) Stereo Speakers and Dolby Atmos8)Solid build qualityIf Anyone ask me what should be improved in this mobile then I would say Battery ( Min 4000mah)For me , 6 hors of Battery Life.For a Normal user It would be enough.But for heavy users I would say,it is decent.Before Buying this one, I have lot of doubts regarding battery etc.My Friends suggest me to rethink before buying this mobile because of some -ve comments.But I dared and ordered this frosted silver color by skipping the glacier blue.It is unique color and iam loving it.Last to mention there are no cons for me.Thank you , Bye"
5,"This is my 3rd OnePlus device in a row. Because of trust on this brand. I started from OnePlus One bacon to 6, and now it's 7T.#Few Highlights after usage of 10 days#-Oxygen Os: this is main reason why i want to choice OnePlus over and over. The community & the user experience is beautiful.-Beautiful fluid Amoled+ Display with 90Hhz Refresh rate.-Powerful Processor of SD855+ chipset + GPU-Super fast 30T warp charge, within 50-60 mins.-Water drop notch, it's beautiful and shorter than previously seen devices.-Sound Quality is amazing due to dolby speakers.-Camera Quality is very good but expected more from OnePlus, thought it bring premium quality but somewhere i feel OnePlus still yet get matured inside photography. Most of the time need to adjust in snapseed for color corrections. Overall, it's still standing best in premium phones.-Build quality is same as OnePlus 6, best!!-In-display fingerprint scanner is fast & accurate.#Few missed#-Headphone Jack : I had to purchase seperate dongle but it need to carry everytime. But the quality from Type-C is still awesome and doesn't feel this for cons.-Battery: Its still 3800 mAh, it's 500 more than OP6 but still due to 90Hz display, needed 300 more.-lack of service centers. This is very important, as OP authorized service centers are limited and available in metros. And i had issue with OP6 so due to lockdown I couldn't able to move out for repairing to other city, so decided to exchange and upgrade. So if they provide pick & drop service that too in each and every region of india.-Notification Light: This is important feature , i don't know why it was removed this.

5,"I research a lot before before buying a new phone, and buying OnePlus 7T after a year of its launch says how strong it is in terms of specs, performance and budget balancing.Pros -1. Super smooth touch (90hz)2. Camera hardware is awesome and if you can sideload Google Cam app into this device,You will see crazy results.3. Superior build quality, Very premium.4. Clean UI and very thoughtfully implemented softwares like fanatic mode for gaming and inbuilt dual apps.5. Good sound output with Dolby digital.6 Superfast.Cons -only 2 what I found but definitely not a deal breaker1. Battery- It gives 5-6 hours of on screen time but it feels soo good when you connect it to charger and go have a cup of coffee and zoop...70% filled.2. Auto brightness mode plays game with you sometimes, mostly while playing games and on a video call. Just use manual brightness mode on these occassions.Hopefully OnePlus will take care of this in software updates.Verdict- Watch out for a deal to get it close to 30k and go for this killer device."
5,"Let me tell you about the major concerning factors of the device first one is battery life which is a weaker part of the phone but not too weak to be worried I get an average of 5hrs 30 min on 90hz and 6hrs 30 min on 60hz which is good considering the capacity.The second thing is camera which I will say a plus part of the phone as the aperture size of f1.6 really creates a difference in low light.Another is macro which is one of the best I have ever seen in any device one can capture macro shots using all the three lens.Wide angle and telephoto are good to go. Nevertheless GCam is the solution for all issues.I have recently found a GCam which works for all the three lenses except macro. You can find it by GCam 7.3 by wichaya XML file . Smoothness,ram management,os, fingerprint,etc are good .And charging is absolutely a charm more than 60% in 30 minutes.Just missing 3.5mm jack. Buy wireless z battery backup is awesome."
5,"1.security.. In screen finger print reader is too good, too fast and much accurate... Even if your finger is oily or dusty...???????????????????? 2. Battery... Battery life is good as compared to 3800 mah battery.. but only if u r using it normally.. if u r a gamer and fun loving or mobile addicted then it will drain in almost 2 to 2.5 hours after heavy gaming... But the wrap charge 30t makes it less annoying nd more comfortable..????????????3. Camera quality is too good with all cameras in day light conditions, in low light conditions but it struggle in night where light is really low... Specially front camera.. it can be enhanced with upcoming updates... ????????????????4. Processor its fabulous... Super fast .. even u r a hard-core gamer or hard-core user .. no matter what type of application u r using, it will run without any lag, without crashing down...

U r going to use to.. if u r using ot u cant go for less ...????????????????????6. Design.. its vart by everyone... What u thik is matter in this point... If u like a new nd different looking back panel - then its for u.. if u dont ... Then u have to manage or sacrifice for other features... Overall look is fabulous as per my opinion... In hand feel is too sexy, trendy and premium feel while holding in hand... Glass back look much better than plastic... Its shiny, classy nd lovely.. metal frame gives strength.... ????????????????????7. Network connectivity... Its just much better than others... Its like this device is hungry for network.. it grabs and pull over all the network speed from any angle .. but never loose the connectivity...????????????????????8. Operating system...

I will give 4.5 out of 5 ... Only only one point less .. because of camera struggles in night section nd battery capacity... otherwise overall experience is too good... Beyond your expectations... Nice work done by (1+)... A suprime package... Lovely device.. big thumbs up for developers ... ??????"
5,"Everything about this phone is among the top tier. The SG 855+ with 8GB RAM shows its domination in power. You would never face a single issue while playing heavy games, multitasking or net drawing speed. The camera image quality is absolutely stunning, both front and back. The resolutions and details obtained will definitely meet your satisfaction. Although it has no macro lens, the software deduced macro is better than most of the phones with a dedicated macro lens. The frosted glass finish on this phone is absolutely brilliant and it looks beautiful. The handheld quality feels nothing but premium with the aluminium frame. The battery life is amazing but not the highest. But it makes up for it with the 30T Warp charging and there would be no complaints ever regarding that. It has an amazing stereo speaker with crisp and loud quality and it is perfect for multimedia. This phone runs on OxygenOS which gives you a premium android feel as well. Lastly the 90Hz refrsh rate in the AMOLED screen will definitely make it feel snappier and more if an enjoyable experience!

5,"This is my opinion and review after 12 days from the date I bought. I thought I was very late to buy this device in 2020 even after watching a lot of review videos in 2020. But I was wrong. This still rocks in 2020. Worth buying. Also considering this is the maximum budget that one have. After booting the device, I got the update and after setting up the device with all latest update, it works very wellBattery: I preferred to use 90Hz refresh rate when the device booted for the first time. For a normal usage that includes social network apps, browsing, sometimes youtube videos gives the 6 to 7 hour screen on time. WIth the heavy gaming, gives you 3 to 4 hours screen on time. Anyway, we have got WARP Charge 30T which charges the device to 70% in 30 minutes. So you don't have to worry about the battery capacity for this device.Camera: Triple camera setup is a killer one. Ultra wide, wide and telephoto. All the three produces perfect pictures. Nightscape mode helps a lot in low light areas. Having a 2x telephoto gives the perfect portrait shots and the ""Super Macro"" mode is the best feature, in my opinion. Video recording is also good. I tried in 4K 60FPS, it was awesomeOxygen OS: In a single line, as always, simple and sweet Android skin. Customization and many options but keeping the OS clean, is the best oneSnapdragon 855 Plus: Performance to the core. Although I'm not the heavy gamer, I did try some games and also edited some videos that I took on this device. There was no lag or hangingStereo Speakers: Dolby Atmos supported stereo speakers has loud and clear audio output. A good oneThe only thing I regret about the device is the missing of 3.5mm headphone jack. Of course, we know it is OnePlus. So, I had to buy Bluetooth headphones. I bought Oneplus bullets Z headphones that works very well with this device.Overall, it is still a good one for this budget range"
5,"Writing this review after an yearI bought both variant (128 & 256GB), one for my mum and another for me.1. Best point is OS, usability, optimization, battery backup everything is amazing.Fanatic mode is perfect for gaming and i love Zen mode (I use it like ""pomodoro technique"" ??)2. Display, No black crush after few updates and if any you noticed, just shoot up the brightness to resolve the same. (90 hz is added bonus)3. Camera 4star, (better than 8 and 8t)Telephoto lens is nice addition at this price point (OP8t or OP8 doesnt have) which can give 2x optical zoom which makes a task easy to take amazing portrait shot.Main cameraOIS at this price with f/1.6 (Most other phone like 8t and 8 has lower value of f/1.7 and f/1.8 respectively, lower the value of aperture better the lens will perform at low light) is perfect.Wide angleThis lens is used for macro shot too which is better than 2mp macro shot than OP83. Battery backup and charging,Although battery is only 3800 mah(6.5 hr SOT @90 hz and 7.5 - 8 hr @ 60 hz, with darkmode) Battery can take you whole day with medium usage @90 hz, can extend the time reducing the the screen refresh rate @60.

5,"Reviewing post 1 year of usage.Brilliant phone, camera picture quality was questionable at the very launch which was fixed by OTA patches. Macro Mode is beautiful and lets face it, you will apply filters to sharpen/beautify images how much ever ""powerful"" the camera is. So good on that part.Battery life has been amazing for an average to heavy user. I havent had to stick in the charger 2-3 times a day unless its a weekend and im intensively glued to to the screen. Even if thats the case the Warp charging makes sure the phone is charged within the hour. It also does not heat up.Phone hasnt lagged yet in the past year. And going for the 256 GB version, i still have 120+ GBs free even though im trying to download as much stuff as possible and making things offline for viewing.Dropped the phone a couple of times but havent seen any damage on it as well as on the camera module.Suggestion - Get tempered glass as soon as you buy the phone for an extra layer of protection as the screen guard bundled is a pretty standard one. The glass though (OnePlus official) is sturdy and tough."
5,"This is my review after 100 days of usage ..Design - premium looks 9.5/10Build quality - excellent 10/10Camera - great camera experience still need some more improvement in the software.Battery life - A one day phone with medium usage not for heavy user . I wished it could have a 4500 mah so that I could have a great battery lifeDisplay - 90hz looks great to your eyes but will a get a hit in battery life. amoled display is stunning it's samsung display so no probs.Forgot about warp charge 30T it's blazing fast will charge it in 65mins..Software - smooth oxygen os no issues..only thing is there is a minor bug which is whenever i speak with other party and after i end the call the display tone changes a bit to oversaturated mode . By default i use that standard mode but after a phone call the saturated mode appears which looks more punchy to eyes but personally i don't like it's a minor bug..I got it on aug 13 at that it was a offer period in Amazon got it with exchange of honor phone at a discounted price of ? - 29049Conclusion - overall a great buy after 2months of patience...and a good one tooo... thumbs up one plus.I still have my old one plus one working but the battery has gone weak now..cheers??

5,"Everything in the phone one could wish for.Specially the stereo firing speakers. Sound is loud and very impressive, with bass coming from speakers.Although I don't like water drop notch, hence using it without notch option (provided by oneplus). Screen brightness is really impressive. Could be used in day under direct sunlight condition. Screen peak brightness around 1100 nits.One more plus point is that, it is slimmer and light in weight. Talking about the UI, you would love the Oxygen OS, as it doesn't contains bloatwares and unwanted apps.Performance is really impressive. Camera I won't say best in class because it provides warm tone in images, but it really does the job. Macro shot attaching in my image.(Also using GCam along with original camera app.)Warp Charging wins your heart. Approx 50-55 min of full charge and half hour charging gives you ~60%.Much impressed by the connectivity options. No signal loss and performing best in network range.

5,"I had a Onplus 6 earlier and after two years, one day it just stopped working. I had a great experience with Oneplus, so decided to replace that with a new Oneplus 7t. I had a choice between Oneplus 8, 8t or 7t pro, but decided to with 7t based on the reviews1. Fingerprint sensor works perfectly, every time. I preferred the rear sensor used in Oneplus 6 compared to the on-screen sensor in this one. When I am driving, it is very natural for me to hold the phone in one hand with my index finger to unlock in single-step. Now I have to press the power button and then put my finger on screen to unlock. (I was wearing sunglasses so face recognition did not work).2. Camera is perfect! I had taken some great shots on this phone that compare favourably with the top-end marquis (and expensive) phones, even during low light.Canera was a very important criteria for me in selecting this phone. And I am quite satisfied with the choice of this phone3. Display is smooth.4. Battery life is fantastic! Charging is excellent! No complaints on either front. I use 60 Hz display most of the time though5. Sound is excellent!6. I use headset quite heavily, so lack of 3.5mm jack was an issue, but I bought oneplus bullets Z wireless headset, which is another great product. Now, I love the convenience7. The phone is a bit heavy in the hand, but it does feel sturdy.On the whole, you get top-end well-rounded phone at an affordable price.If you are one of those guys who don't want to compromise much on performance, camera, audio quality, speaker volume, battery performance and at the same time want a phone that is value for money, this is the right phone for you!"
5,"I have been using 3 devices of OP. OP3, OP6T and OP7T, what I can say that the experience has improved. The smoothness of the screen yet it's speedy. The comfort in the hand yet the heavy build quality.All 3 cameras have a useful image quality that does not fade or blur, Macro wide or primary I can take a good quality picture. The chipset, ohhhh games or multitasking or taking it to make a work profile usage.All works great, smooth switching between apps, no lags in heavy games. All the apps are always open I do not close the app just switches to another app. Useful gestures for navigation, music control and others.Fast unlocking option with a finger or by face, and it's real quick.As I mentioned above I use the work profile, which is Google-provided. So using google sheet, Google docs, doing meeting it's a handy one, the big screen comes in handy here. Google sheet creation data update is just quick.I take out a lot from this device, my work, personal even sometimes a remote control.When I brought OP3, I called it a ""Beast"", so the OP7T."
5,"Great camera and especially one person can recommend this device for macro photography.Cons: -Slow updates -Battery issue at 90hz refresh rate. -Display brightness not accurate. Kind 400dpi is less only. -Expensive like 37999 for a smartphone so be prepared for it. - As many of you have seen jerryrigeverything video, this phone failed bend test and I do feel that sometimes it can break on normal drop.So do buy a military grade rugged cover either spigen, fusion x, or UAGPros: -Oxygen os makes it easy to use. - Macro camera and wideangle shots come really nice in this device. -Oreo shaped camera some people like that some people don't, I am personally big fan of it. -Network connectivity is by far the best in this device I am getting wifi speed upto 120 to 150 Mbps.

Till now battery backup, phone speed and camera quality , touch sensor and finger print reader does it's job as a new mobile phone. I'm a mobile phone gamer... I'm playing COD, PUBG, COC and FIFA on a daily basis however phone speed doesn't seems to be down and once in a blue moon phone goes to the infinity loop reboot and I just hard reboot the phone and boom everything is back to business! No much heating issues Ive noticed on normal usage... It's really bang for a buck if yu know how to really use a mobile phone.."
